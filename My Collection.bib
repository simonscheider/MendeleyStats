abstract = {<p>We examined whether self-ratings of “being active” among older people living in four different settings (major city high and lower density suburbs, a regional city, and a rural area) were associated with out-of-home participation and outdoor physical activity. A mixed-methods approach (survey, travel diary, and GPS tracking over a one-week period) was used to gather data from 48 individuals aged over 55 years. Self-ratings of “being active” were found to be positively correlated with the number of days older people spent time away from home but unrelated to time traveled by active means (walking and biking). No significant differences in active travel were found between the four study locations, despite differences in their respective built environments. The findings suggest that additional strategies to the creation of “age-friendly” environments are needed if older people are to increase their levels of outdoor physical activity. “Active aging” promotion campaigns may need to explicitly identify the benefits of walking outdoors to ambulatory older people as a means of maintaining their overall health, functional ability, and participation within society in the long-term and also encourage the development of community-based programs in order to facilitate regular walking for this group.</p>},

abstract = {This study examined relationships between greenness exposure and free-living physical activity behavior of children in smart growth and conventionally designed communities. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to quantify children's (n=208) greenness exposure at 30-s epoch accelerometer and GPS data points. A generalized linear mixed model with a kernel density smoothing term for addressing spatial autocorrelation was fit to analyze residential neighborhood activity data. Excluding activity at home and during school-hours, an epoch-level analysis found momentary greenness exposure was positively associated with the likelihood of contemporaneous moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). This association was stronger for smart growth residents who experienced a 39{\%} increase in odds of MVPA for a 10th to 90th percentile increase in exposure to greenness (OR=1.39, 95{\%} CI 1.36-1.44). An individual-level analysis found children who experienced >20. min of daily exposure to greener spaces (>90th percentile) engaged in nearly 5 times the daily rate of MVPA of children with nearly zero daily exposure to greener spaces (95{\%} CI 3.09-7.20). ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Physical activity (PA) in childhood is related to a multitude of short- and long-term health consequences. School recess can contribute with up to 40{\%} of the recommended 60. min of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). This paper aims to investigate how schoolchildren use different schoolyard areas during recess and whether these areas are associated with different levels of PA. Time spent by 316 students (grade 5-8) in five types of schoolyard area was measured during at least two days and four separate recess period per person (in total 1784 recess periods), using global positioning system (GPS) and the level of activity was measured using accelerometers. Total time spent and proportions of time spent sedentary and in MVPA were calculated per area type. Significant differences in PA levels were found. Grass and playground areas had the highest proportion of time in MVPA and solid surface areas had the highest proportion of time spent sedentary. Boys and children spent a higher proportion of time in MVPA. Girls accumulated more sedentary time in all area types compared to boys. This finding emphasizes the importance of investigating various settings and features in schoolyards in promoting PA. Grass and playground areas may play an important role in promoting PA in schoolyards, while a high proportion of time in solid surface areas is spent sedentary. In future, more detailed studies of the exact schoolyard setting using a combination of GPS, accelerometer and direct observation would be beneficial.},

abstract = {For rehabilitation and diagnoses, an understanding of patient activities and movements is important. Modern smartphones have built in accelerometers which promise to enable quantifying minute-by-minute what patients do (e.g. walk or sit). Such a capability could inform recommendations of physical activities and improve medical diagnostics. However, a major problem is that during everyday life, we carry our phone in different ways, e.g. on our belt, in our pocket, in our hand, or in a bag. The recorded accelerations are not only affected by our activities but also by the phone's location. Here we develop a method to solve this kind of problem, based on the intuition that activities change rarely, and phone locations change even less often. A hidden Markov model (HMM) tracks changes across both activities and locations, enabled by a static support vector machine (SVM) classifier that probabilistically identifies activity-location pairs. We find that this approach improves tracking accuracy on healthy subjects as compared to a static classifier alone. The obtained method can be readily applied to patient populations. Our research enables the use of phones as activity tracking devices, without the need of previous approaches to instruct subjects to always carry the phone in the same location. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Objectives: It is not known if the activity profile of elite Australian football players changes across two levels of competition. The aims of this study were therefore to: (1) classify the activity profile of elite and sub-elite Australian football for players from one elite Australian football club; and (2) compare the activity profile of elite footballers across both elite and sub-elite competitions. Design: Quantitative case-study approach. Methods: Movement was recorded by 5 Hz global positioning system and expressed relative to game time for total; and high-velocity running distance (4.17-10.00 m s(-1)) and maximal accelerations (2.78-10.00 m s(-2)). The difference was expressed as a percentage and effect size statistic with confidence intervals. Results: Elite Australian football players had 8{\%} greater total 11{\%} more high intensity running; and 16{\%} more maximal accelerations during matches in 2009 compared to 2008. Players at a sub-elite level had no change in total; 9{\%} less high intensity running but 23{\%} greater maximal accelerations during the same period. In 2008 there was a 5{\%} lower total covered by players in sub-elite competition; no difference in high intensity running; and 28{\%} less maximal accelerations compared to elite. In 2009 the gap was larger for distance of running as sub-elite had 15{\%} less total and 20{\%} less high intensity running than elite. Similar to 2008, sub-elite players had 23{\%} less maximal accelerations in 2009. Conclusions: The activity profile of players in the elite competition has increased over these two seasons, but not in the sub-elite. This has implications for teams where players must move between competitions during the season. (C) 2012 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This research work addresses the comparison of trip dynamics, energy consumption, CO2 and NOx Well-to-Wheel impacts of 5 transportation alternatives (conventional and electric bicycles, conventional and electric vehicles and an urban bus) in Lisbon, Portugal. On-road monitoring of a specific route in Lisbon revealed that bikers using electric bicycles increased their average speed between 8{\%} and 26{\%} compared to their use of the conventional bicycle, especially in the route sections with positive slopes (up to 49{\%} increases). Electric bicycles result in a Tank-to-Wheel energy consumption of 0.028 MJ/km, allowing an average autonomy of 46 km between recharging. When comparing the 5 transportation alternatives, the electric bicycles presented a higher travel time of 13.5{\%}, 1.9{\%} and 7.8{\%} over the bus, low powered electric vehicle, and standard electric vehicle/conventional technologies, respectively. Regarding the Well-to-Wheel energy consumption analysis, the results indicated that, when compared to the other transportation solutions, the electric bicycle only uses 11{\%}, 3{\%}, 1{\%}, 2{\%} and 4{\%} of the energy required when using the low powered electric vehicle, standard electric vehicle, conventional gasoline and diesel technologies and bus, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis of Well-to-Wheel emissions reveals that the electric bicycle has 13{\%} and 4{\%} lower CO2 emissions and 12{\%} and 4{\%} lower NOx emissions when compared to the low powered and standard electric vehicles, respectively. This research work allows sustaining that bicycles can be considered interesting solutions for urban trips, with comparable trip times to other transportation modes, as well as zero local emissions and reduced Well-to- Wheel pollutant impacts, contributing significantly for the improvement of the overall urban air quality.},

The aims of this study were to assess the convergent validity and the test-retest reliability of a GPS device for measuring repeated sprint ability test (RSAT) variables. Two groups participated in this study, a group of 21 physical education students (age: 20.2 ?? 2.3 years, stature: 1.75 ?? 0.42 m, body mass: 68.0 ?? 6.8 kg) and a second group 14 elite junior soccer players (age: 14.5 ?? 1.2 years, stature: 1.60 ?? 0.09 m, body mass: 57.7 ?? 3.8 kg) volunteered to participate in this study. Convergent validity was assessed as the correlation between sprint performance (15 and 30-m) using both timing lights and a portable GPS device during a RSAT (7 ?? 30-m sprints with 30-s of active recovery). The 7 ?? 30-m RSAT test-retest reliability using GPS device was assessed in elite junior soccer players repeating the test 1 week apart and expressing reliability as a coefficient of variation. Results showed a strong correlation between peak speed measures with the GPS device and RSAT performance measured with timing lights for the 15-m (r2 = 0.87, p < 0.001, N = 147) and 30-m (r2 = 0.94, p < 0.001, N = 147) splits, respectively. There was a low coefficient of variation for summated maximal speed (1.7{\%}) and peak speed (1.2{\%}) during the 7 ?? 30-m RSAT, but high variation for the percentage decrement score (36.2{\%}). These results provide evidence to support the use of the GPS device as an alternative measure to assess repeated sprint performance but suggest a percentage decrement score is not a reliable measure of RSAT performance. ?? 2009 Sports Medicine Australia.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study was conducted to devise a new individual calibration method to enhance MTI accelerometer estimation of free-living level walking speed. Method: Five female and five male middle-aged adults walked 400 m at 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 km·h-1, and 800 m at 6.5 km·h -1 on an outdoor track, following a continuous protocol. Lap speed was controlled by a global positioning system (GPS) monitor. MTI counts-to-speed calibration equations were derived for each trial, for each subject for four such trials with each of four MTI, for each subject for the average MTI, and for the pooled data. Standard errors of the estimate (SEE) with and without individual calibration were compared. To assess accuracy of prediction of free-living walking speed, subjects also completed a self-paced, "brisk" 3-km walk wearing one of the four MTI, and differences between actual and predicted walking speed with and without individual calibration were examined. Results: Correlations between MTI counts and walking speed were 0.90 without individual calibration, 0.98 with individual calibration for the average MTI, and 0.99 with individual calibration for a specific MTI. The SEE (mean ± SD) was 0.58 ± 0.30 km·h-1 without individual calibration, 0.19 ± 0.09 km·h-1 with individual calibration for the average MTI monitor, and 0.16 ± 0.08 km·h -1 with individual calibration for a specific MTI monitor. The difference between actual and predicted walking speed on the "brisk" 3-km walk was 0.06 ± 0.25 km·h-1 using individual calibration and 0.28 ± 0.63 km·h-1 without individual calibration (for specific accelerometers). Conclusion: MTI accuracy in predicting walking speed without individual calibration might be sufficient for population-based studies but not for intervention trials. This individual calibration method will substantially increase precision of walking speed predicted from MTI counts. Copyright © 2006 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

abstract = {Study Design. Pilot study. Objective. To examine whether surgical outcomes can be assessed objectively by advanced tracking technology, based on Global Posi-tioning Systems (GPS). Summary of Background Data. Outcome studies are the com-monest way to assess the results of surgical procedures. The suc-cess of these efforts is impeded by a number of factors, including the lack of valid outcome measures, diffi culty in assessing changes in patients' expectations (response shift) and confounding effects of secondary gains. Methods. The measurement of walking speed, distances, and num-ber of walking events per day, claudication index (maximal walking distance), characteristics during motorized trips, and the amount of time spent outdoors were monitored in 2 patients undergoing spine surgery for several weeks using advanced tracking technologies. Results. In 1 patient, all parameters increased progressively from the time of surgery to the end of the recording period. These fi ndings were consistent with her recovery from surgery. In a second patient, tracking showed the patient's diffi culty in mobilizing, leading to the diagnosis of another orthopedic problem, and to total hip replacement surgery. Conclusion. The technology presented in this pilot appears to be useful in understanding a patient's level and breathe of activity. These data will assist in better understanding the limitations imposed by specifi c musculoskeletal pathology and in monitoring perioperative function and complications and their related causes. Spatial data may indirectly refl ect a patient's social and mental conditions. This interdisciplinary pilot may lead to the development of valid outcome measures for a range of medical conditions. Studies comparing ques-tionnaires to this new outcome measure may shed light on issues like response shifts and secondary gain. Norms and clusters of spatial behaviors in different pathologies may enable better patient selection for medical, mental, and surgical interventions. T he outcome of surgery can be assessed in various ways. Data can be obtained from various persons—the patient, the treating physician, or an independent ob-server 1 and using various methods (questionnaires, observa-tions, measures of physical performance, radiographs). The quality of data obtained by these methods varies. Ideally, an outcome tool should be valid, simple, quick, reliable, reproducible, and sensitive to change. 2 One of the most popular ways of measuring outcomes is through the use of self administered questionnaires. They include the following 3 major types: general health, 3 disease specifi c, 4 and patient satisfaction. Many of the commonly used outcome question-naires in orthopedic surgery (for example, that of Harris) 5 have never been validated. Moreover, although they may be reliable, patients' self assessments do not necessarily refl ect their actual condition. For example, in 1 study, patients with intermittent claudication due to lumbar spinal canal stenosis were asked to assess their walking distances. Although self-reports yielded a wide range of walking abilities, most pa-tients were able to walk the same distance of about 200 m. This raises questions about the validity of patient self-report questionnaires in this area. 6 A response shift is a psychological change in one's perception of the quality of life following a change in health status. The idea goes back to the days of Plato. 7 This phenomenon initially was recognized in patients with terminal diseases who, despite a worsening of the physical condition, did not necessarily report deterioration in quality of life—a positive response shift. 8 Response shift was recently studied in total knee arthroplasty—a negative response shift, 9,10 and the basis for its study in spine surgery has been described, 11 with a review of current data in orthopedic and spine surgery published recently. 12 This psychological process, resulting in a change in the expectations of people when com-pares between the pre-and the postoperative period, leads to},

Common objective measures included accelerometry, global positioning systems and direct observation; questionnaires, surveys and interviews were common subjective measures. Focus groups, activity logs, monitoring sheets, travel/activity diaries, behavioral maps and guided tours were also utilized. Questionnaires were used most frequently, yet few studies used the same questionnaire. Five studies employed comprehensive, mixed-methods designs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Outdoor play and children's independent mobility have been measured using a wide variety of techniques, with only a few studies using similar methodologies. A standardized methodological approach does not exist. Future researchers should consider including both objective measures (accelerometry and global positioning systems) and subjective measures (questionnaires, activity logs, interviews), as more comprehensive designs will enhance understanding of each multidimensional construct. Creating a standardized methodological approach would improve study comparisons.},

abstract = {Integration of individual time-location patterns with spatially resolved exposure maps enables a more accurate estimation of personal exposures to environmental pollutants than using estimates at fixed locations. Current global positioning system (GPS) devices can be used to track an individual's location. However, information on GPS-performance in environmental exposure assessment is largely missing. We therefore performed two studies. First, a commute-study, where the commute of 12 individuals was tracked twice, testing GPS-performance for five transport modes and two wearing modes. Second, an urban-tracking study, where one individual was tracked repeatedly through different areas, focused on the effect of building obstruction on GPS-performance. The median error from the true path for walking was 3.7 m, biking 2.9 m, train 4.8 m, bus 4.9 m, and car 3.3 m. Errors were larger in a high-rise commercial area (median error=7.1 m) compared with a low-rise residential area (median error=2.2 m). Thus, GPS-performance largely depends on the transport mode and urban built-up. Although {\~{}}85{\%} of all errors were <10 m, almost 1{\%} of the errors were >50 m. Modern GPS-devices are useful tools for environmental exposure assessment, but large GPS-errors might affect estimates of exposures with high spatial variability.},

abstract = {Exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP) may have adverse health effects. Central monitoring stations do not represent the personal exposure to UFP accurately. Few studies have previously focused on personal exposure to UFP. Sixty non-smoking residents living in Copenhagen, Denmark were asked to carry a backpack equipped with a portable monitor, continuously recording particle number concentrations (PN), in order to measure the real-time individual exposure over a period of similar to 48 h. A GPS logger was carried along with the particle monitor and allowed us to estimate the contribution of UFP exposure occurring in various microenvironments (residence, during active and passive transport, other indoor and outdoor environments) to the total daily exposure. On average, the fractional contribution of each microenvironment to the daily integrated personal exposure roughly corresponded to the fractions of the day the subjects spent in each microenvironment. The home environment accounted for 50{\%} of the daily personal exposure. Indoor environments other than home or vehicles contributed with similar to 40{\%}. The highest median UFP concentration was obtained during passive transport (vehicles). However, being in transit or outdoors contributed 5{\%} or less to the daily exposure. Additionally, the subjects recorded in a diary the periods when they were at home. With this approach, 66{\%} of the total daily exposure was attributable to the home environment. The subjects spent 28{\%} more time at home according to the diary, compared to the GPS. These results may indicate limitations of using diaries, but also possible inaccuracy and miss-classification in the GPS data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recent research suggests coastal environments may promote human health and wellbeing. This article explores the diverse coastal experiences sought out by residents of two towns in south west England to promote and preserve their personal wellbeing in the context of their everyday lives. It draws on the findings of an in-depth interpretive study conducted from May to November 2013 that examined the relative contribution of varied green and blue space experiences to individual wellbeing through the life course. Personalised activity maps produced using accelerometer and Global Positioning System (GPS) data were used to guide in-depth geo-narrative interviews with a purposive sample of 33 participants. This was combined with a subset of nine case study go-along interviews in places deemed therapeutic by the participants themselves, offering deeper insight into the lived experiences and relationships playing out within such places. Situated in a novel adaptation of the therapeutic landscapes framework, this article explores how symbolic, achievement-oriented, immersive and social experiences contributed to participants' sense of wellbeing in their local coastal areas. Participants expressed particularly strong and often enduring connections to the local coastline, with different coastal stretches perceived to cater for varied therapeutic needs and interests, at multiple scales and intensities. The findings suggest the need for greater acknowledgement of people's emotional, deeply embodied and often shared connections to the coast within coastal management policy and practice, both nationally and internationally. Importantly, such efforts should recognise the fluid, dynamic nature of this land-sea boundary, and the valued therapeutic experiences linked to this fluidity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

By drawing on the experiences of an interpretive study seeking to situate people's green space wellbeing practices within their daily lives, we suggest value in using personalised maps - produced using participant accelerometer (physical activity) and Global Positioning System (GPS) data - alongside in-depth and mobile go-along' qualitative interview approaches. After introducing the study and the methods adopted, the paper discusses three opportunities offered by this mixed method approach to contribute a more nuanced, contextualised understanding of participants' green space experiences. These include: (a) the benefits of engaging participants in the interpretation of their own practices; (b) the value of using maps to provide a visual aid to discussion about the importance of participants' routine, often pre-reflective practices; and (c) the production of a layered appreciation of participants' local green and blue space wellbeing experiences. Used in combination, such methods have the potential to provide a more comprehensive picture of how current green space experiences, be they infrequent and meaningful, or more routine and habitual, are shaped by everyday individual agency, life circumstances and past place experiences.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Optimal mental health care is dependent upon sensitive and early detection of mental health problems. We have introduced a state-of-the-art method for the current study for remote behavioral monitoring that transports assessment out of the clinic and into the environments in which individuals negotiate their daily lives. The objective of this study was to examine whether the information captured with multimodal smartphone sensors can serve as behavioral markers for one's mental health. We hypothesized that (a) unobtrusively collected smartphone sensor data would be associated with individuals' daily levels of stress, and (b) sensor data would be associated with changes in depression, stress, and subjective loneliness over time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: A total of 47 young adults (age range: 19-30 years) were recruited for the study. Individuals were enrolled as a single cohort and participated in the study over a 10-week period. Participants were provided with smartphones embedded with a range of sensors and software that enabled continuous tracking of their geospatial activity (using the Global Positioning System and wireless fidelity), kinesthetic activity (using multiaxial accelerometers), sleep duration (modeled using device-usage data, accelerometer inferences, ambient sound features, and ambient light levels), and time spent proximal to human speech (i.e., speech duration using microphone and speech detection algorithms). Participants completed daily ratings of stress, as well as pre- and postmeasures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; Spitzer, Kroenke, {\&} Williams, 1999), stress (Perceived Stress Scale; Cohen et al., 1983), and loneliness (Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale; Russell, Peplau, {\&} Cutrona, 1980).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Mixed-effects linear modeling showed that sensor-derived geospatial activity (p < .05), sleep duration (p < .05), and variability in geospatial activity (p < .05), were associated with daily stress levels. Penalized functional regression showed associations between changes in depression and sensor-derived speech duration (p < .05), geospatial activity (p < .05), and sleep duration (p < .05). Changes in loneliness were associated with sensor-derived kinesthetic activity (p < .01).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Smartphones can be harnessed as instruments for unobtrusive monitoring of several behavioral indicators of mental health. Creative leveraging of smartphone sensing could provide novel opportunities for close-to-invisible psychiatric assessment at a scale and efficiency that far exceeds what is currently feasible with existing assessment technologies.},

abstract = {Purpose: No study has investigated the frequency and nature of repeated high-intensity-effort (RHIE) bouts across elite and semielite rugby league competitions. This study examined RHIE activity in rugby league match play across playing standards. Participants: 36 elite and 64 semielite rugby league players. Methods: Global positioning system analysis was completed during 17 elite and 14 semielite matches. Results: The most commonly occurring RHIE bouts involved 2 efforts (2-RHIE) for both elite and semielite players. Only small differences were found in 2-RHIE activity between elite and semielite match play (effect size [ES] >= 0.31 +/- 0.15, >= 88{\%}, likely). RHIE bouts were more likely to involve contact as the number of efforts in a bout increased (ES >= 0.40 +/- 0.15, 100{\%}, almost certainly). Semielite players performed a greater proportion of 2-contact-effort RHIE bouts than their elite counterparts (68.2{\%} vs 60.6{\%}, ES 0.33 +/- 0.15, 92{\%}, likely), while elite players performed a greater proportion of 3-effort bouts (26.9{\%} vs 21.1{\%}, ES 0.31 +/- 0.15, 88{\%}, likely). Elite players also had a shorter recovery (1.00-3.99 vs >= 4.00 min) between RHIE bouts (ES >= 1.60 +/- 0.71, >= 94{\%}, likely). Conclusion: These findings highlight the RHIE demands of elite and semielite rugby league match play. Elite players are more likely to perform RHIE bouts consisting of 3 efforts and to have a shorter recovery time between bouts. Exposing players to these RHIE demands in training is likely to improve their ability to tolerate the most demanding passages of match play.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields is necessary for epidemiological studies on possible health effects. The main goal of this study is to determine the exposure level and spatial and temporal variances during 39 everyday activities in 12 frequency bands used in mobile telecommunication and broadcasting. Therefore, 24h measurements were gathered from 98 volunteers living in or near Amsterdam and Purmerend, The Netherlands. They carried an activity diary to be kept to the minute, a GPS logger sampling at an interval of 1s, and an EME Spy exposimeter with a detection limit of 0.0066mW/m2 sampling at an interval of 10s in 12 frequency bands. The mean exposure over 24h, excluding own mobile phone use, was 0.180mW/m2. During daytime exposure was about the same, but during night it was about half, and in the evening it was about twice as high. The main contribution to environmental exposure (calling by participant not included) is from calling with mobile phones (37.5{\%}), from cordless DECT phones and their docking stations (31.7{\%}), and from the base stations (12.7{\%}). The exposure to mobile phone base stations increases with the percentage of urban ground use, which is an indication for high people density. In agreement, the highest mean exposure relates to the activities with high people density, such as travelling by public transport, visiting social events, pubs or shopping malls. Exposure at home depends mainly on exposure from people calling in the neighbourhood of the participant and thus on the number of persons in a household. In addition just the possession of DECT docking stations leads to exposure as most models transmit continuously in stand-by. Also wireless internet routers continuously transmit in the WiFi band. Though the highest exposure peaks in the WiFi band, up to 0.265W/m2, come from stray radiation of microwave ovens. The mean total exposure largely depends on phone calls of a high exposure level and short duration. These calls lead to potentially high contrasts as well in exposure levels between sessions of the same activity as between persons, thus posing a challenge for personal exposure prediction. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Purpose It is well established that the perioperative course in terms of patient satisfaction, neurological function and quality of life, is assessed by monitoring the walking capacity. This examination method is affected by several primary and secondary influences. Therefore, we performed a feasibility study to investigate the possibility of assessing the perioperative walking capacity using a global positioning system (GPS) in neurosurgical spine patients. A step was undertaken to generate objective and reliable data for monitoring control with a cost-effective and easy-to-use measurement tool. Methods Everyday life activities of four patients were measured by using a GPS-capable mobile phone (a week preoperatively, FU 3 months later). Our custom-made software for Android systems continuously records the position- and movement-data of all subjects during the day at 1 s intervals. The position date were smoothed and checked for plausibility. This semi-automated process was followed by determining the total distance walked (TL), the average distance (AL), the average walking speed (V) and the total walking duration per day (T). Additionally, we are able to explore the measuring inaccuracy. Results In three patients, nearly all parameters were increased in the follow-up examination (TL: 650.76, 972.63, and 269.07 {\%}. AL: 1213.83, 3117.89, and 72.23 {\%}. V: 78.62, -15.50, and 8.54 {\%}. T: 148.18, 4089.56, and 9.08 {\%}). In one patient, we documented a different motion pattern (TL: -54.37 {\%}, AL: -31.56 {\%}, V: -9.20 {\%}, T increased: 507.91 {\%}) due to residual limitations after suffering a heart attack. Conclusion In this feasibility study, we demonstrated that this tool is able to measure the perioperative mobility and walking-capability. The certainty of data is dependent on the patients' compliance. The measuring method is used as a low cost, easily accessible, and easy-to-use technique, which seems to be superior to common methods like a treadmill-tests or walking tests. Nevertheless, these results are still to prove in upcoming analysis.},

METHODS: The RECORD GPS Study collected real-life trip data from 236 participants over 7 days, including the transportation mode, GPS, GIS, and accelerometer data. A prediction model of transportation modes was constructed using the random forests method. Finally, we investigated the performance of models based on a limited number of participants/trips to predict transportation modes for a large number of trips. RESULTS: The full model had a correct prediction rate of 90{\%}. A simpler model of GPS explanatory variables combined with GIS variables performed nearly as well. Relatively good predictions could be made using a model based on the 991 trips of the first 30 participants. CONCLUSION: This study uses real-life data from a large sample set to test a method for predicting transportation modes at the trip level, thereby providing a useful complement to time unit-level prediction methods. By enabling predictions based on a limited number of observations, this method may decrease the workload for participants/researchers and provide relevant trip-level data to investigate relationships between transportation and health.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We assessed effects on physical activity (PA) and weight among participants in a complete street intervention that extended a light-rail line in Salt Lake City, Utah. METHODS: Participants in the Moving Across Places Study resided within 2 kilometers of the new line. They wore accelerometers and global positioning system (GPS) loggers for 1 week before and after rail construction. Regression analyses compared change scores of participants who never rode transit with continuing, former, and new riders, after adjustment for control variables (total n = 537). RESULTS: New riders had significantly more accelerometer-measured counts per minute than never-riders (P < .01), and former riders had significantly fewer (P < .01). New riders lost (P < .05) and former riders gained (P < .01) weight. Former riders lost 6.4 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) per 10 hours of accelerometer wear (P < .01) and gained 16.4 minutes of sedentary time (P < .01). New riders gained 4.2 MVPA minutes (P < .05) and lost 12.8 (P < .05) sedentary minutes per 10 hours accelerometer wear. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the health benefits of transit ridership in the complete street area, research should address how to encourage more sustained ridership. (Am J Public Health.

Design In Salt Lake City, Utah, adults wore accelerometer and Global Positioning System (GPS) loggers for a week in a cross-sectional study to establish baseline travel and activity patterns near a planned Complete Street intervention involving a new rail line, new sidewalks and a bike path. Results At the end of the week, research assistants met with the 918 participants who had at least three 10 h days of good accelerometer readings. Accelerometer and GPS data were uploaded and integrated within a custom application, and participants were provided with maps and time information for past MVPA bouts of {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}= 3 min to help them recall bout details. Participants said that 'getting someplace' was, on average, a more important motivation for their bouts than leisure or exercise. A series of recall tests showed that participants recalled most bouts they were asked about, regardless of the duration of the bout, suggesting that participant perceptions of their shorter lifestyle bouts can be studied with this methodology. Visual prompting with a map depicting where each bout took place yielded more accurate recall than prompting with time cues alone. Conclusions These techniques provide a novel way to understand participant memories of the context and subjective assessments associated with healthy bouts of PA. Prompts with time-stamped maps that illustrate places of MVPA offer an effective method to improve understanding of activity and its supportive sociophysical contexts.},

Time-motion analyses (global positioning system) were performed on 77 players (U13-U18; fullbacks [FB], centre-backs [CB], midfielders [MD], wide midfielders [W], second strikers [2(nd)S] and strikers [S]) during 42 international club games. Total distance covered (TD) and very high-intensity activities (VHIA; > 16.1 km.h(-1)) were computed during 186 entire player-matches.

Match running performance showed an increasing trend with age (P < 0.001, partial eta-squared (eta(2)): 0.20-0.45). When adjusted for age and individual playing time, match running performance was position-dependent (P < 0.001, eta(2) : 0.13-0.40). MD covered the greater TD; CB the lowest (P < 0.05). Distance for VHIA was lower for CB compared with all other positions (P < 0.05); W and S displayed the highest VHIA (P < 0.05). Relationships between match running performance and physical capacities were position-dependent, with poor or non-significant correlations within FB, CB, MD and W (e.g., VHIA vs. V(Vam-eval) : r = 0.06 in FB) but large associations within 2(nd)S and S positions (e.g., VHIA vs. V(Vam-eval) : r = 0.70 in 2(nd)S). In highly trained young soccer players, the importance of fitness level as a determinant of match running performance should be regarded as a function of playing position.},

abstract = {Background Ecological approaches have highlighted the importance of the built environment as a factor affecting physical activity. However, knowledge on children's activity patterns is still incomplete. Particularly, data on the spatial context of physical activity is limited, which limits the potential to design location-based interventions effectively. Using global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometry, this study aimed to identify locations where children engage in moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Methods Participants included 119 children (11-14 years, 57{\%} girls) from public schools in Winterthur, Switzerland. During a regular school week between February and April 2013, children wore an accelerometer and GPS sensor for seven consecutive days. Time-matched accelerometer and GPS data was mapped with a geographic information system and each data point was assigned to one of seven defined activity settings. Both the absolute amount of MVPA and proportion of time in MVPA were calculated for every setting. Multilevel analyses accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data were conducted to investigate any gender differences. Results Children achieved most MVPA on streets (34.5{\%}) and on school grounds (33.4{\%}). The proportion children spent in MVPA was highest in recreational facilities (19.4{\%}), at other schools (19.2{\%}) and on streets (18.6{\%}). Boys accumulated significantly more MVPA overall and on other school grounds (p {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.05) and showed a significantly higher proportion of time in MVPA at own school and outside of Winterthur (p {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.05). Conclusions The results indicate the importance of streets and school grounds as activity-promoting environments. The high use of streets may be an indicator for active transportation, which appears to contribute to an active lifestyle in both genders. In contrast, the school setting is more likely to encourage physical activity in boys. Recreational facilities seem to be conducive for MVPA among both genders, although infrequently visited during the week of measurement.},

abstract = {Exposure to ultrafine particles (UFPs) is deemed to be a major risk affecting human health. Therefore, airborne particle studies were performed in the recent years to evaluate the most critical micro-environments, as well as identifying the main UFP sources.Nonetheless, in order to properly evaluate the UFP exposure, personal monitoring is required as the only way to relate particle exposure levels to the activities performed and micro-environments visited.To this purpose, in the present work, the results of experimental analysis aimed at showing the effect of the time-activity patterns on UFP personal exposure are reported. In particular, 24 non-smoking couples (12 during winter and summer time, respectively), comprised of a man who worked full-time and a woman who was a homemaker, were analyzed using personal particle counter and GPS monitors. Each couple was investigated for a 48-h period, during which they also filled out a diary reporting the daily activities performed. Time activity patterns, particle number concentration exposure and the related dose received by the participants, in terms of particle alveolar-deposited surface area, were measured.The average exposure to particle number concentration was higher for women during both summer and winter (Summer: women 1.8×104 part. cm-3; men 9.2×103 part. cm-3; Winter: women 2.9×104 part. cm-3; men 1.3×104 part. cm-3), which was likely due to the time spent undertaking cooking activities. Staying indoors after cooking also led to higher alveolar-deposited surface area dose for both women and men during the winter time (9.12×102 and 6.33×102mm2, respectively), when indoor ventilation was greatly reduced. The effect of cooking activities was also detected in terms of women's dose intensity (dose per unit time), being 8.6 and 6.6 in winter and summer, respectively. On the contrary, the highest dose intensity activity for men was time spent using transportation (2.8 in both winter and summer). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Further, comparing GPS and GIS measures of environmental exposures along routes to and from school, we tested for evidence of selective daily mobility bias when using GPS data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This study is a cross-sectional analysis, using objective assessments of body weight in relation to multiple environmental exposures. Data presented are from a sample of 94 school-aged children, aged 5-11 years. Children's heights and weights were measured by trained researchers, and used to calculate BMI z-scores. Participants wore a GPS device for one full week. Environmental exposures were estimated within home and school neighbourhoods, and along GIS (modelled) and GPS (actual) routes from home to school. We directly compared associations between BMI and GIS-modelled versus GPS-derived environmental exposures. The study was conducted in Mebane and Mount Airy, North Carolina, USA, in 2011.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In adjusted regression models, greater school walkability was associated with significantly lower mean BMI. Greater home walkability was associated with increased BMI, as was greater school access to green space. Adjusted associations between BMI and route exposure characteristics were null. The use of GPS-actual route exposure did not appear to confound associations between environmental exposures and BMI in this sample.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study found few associations between environmental exposures in home, school and commuting domains and body weight in children. However, walkability of the school neighbourhood may be important. Of the other significant associations observed, some were in unexpected directions. Importantly, we found no evidence of selective daily mobility bias in this sample, although our study design is in need of replication in a free-living adult sample.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess validity of the Personal Activity Location Measurement System (PALMS) for deriving time spent walking/running, bicycling, and in vehicle, using SenseCam as the comparison.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: 40 adult cyclists wore a Qstarz BT-Q1000XT GPS data logger and SenseCam (camera worn around neck capturing multiple images every minute) for a mean of 4 days. PALMS used distance and speed between GPS points to classify whether each minute was part of a trip (yes/no), and if so, the trip mode (walking/running, bicycling, in vehicle). SenseCam images were annotated to create the same classifications (i.e., trip yes/no and mode). 2x2 contingency tables and confusion matrices were calculated at the minute-level for PALMS vs. SenseCam classifications. Mixed-effects linear regression models estimated agreement (mean differences and intraclass correlations [ICCs]) between PALMS and SenseCam with regards to minutes/day in each mode.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Minute-level sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value were ≥88{\%}, and positive predictive value was ≥75{\%} for non mode-specific trip detection. 72-80{\%} of outdoor walking/running minutes, 73{\%} of bicycling minutes, and 74-76{\%} of in-vehicle minutes were correctly classified by PALMS. For minutes/day, PALMS had a mean bias (i.e., amount of over or under estimation) of 2.4-3.1 minutes (11-15{\%}) for walking/running, 2.3-2.9 minutes (7-9{\%}) for bicycling, and 4.3-5 minutes (15-17{\%}) for vehicle time. ICCs were ≥.80 for all modes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: PALMS has validity for processing GPS data to objectively measure time walking/running, bicycling, and in vehicle in population studies. Assessing travel patterns is one of many valuable applications of GPS in physical activity research that can improve our understanding of the determinants and health outcomes of active transportation as well as its impact on physical activity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare adolescents' physical activity at home, near home, at school, near school, and at other locations.

METHODS: Adolescents (N = 549) were ages 12 to 16 years (49.9{\%} girls, 31.3{\%} nonwhite or Hispanic) from 447 census block groups in 2 US regions. Accelerometers and Global Positioning System devices assessed minutes of and proportion of time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in each of the 5 locations. Mixed-effects regression compared MVPA across locations and demographic factors.

RESULTS: Forty-two percent of adolescents' overall MVPA occurred at school, 18.7{\%} at home, 18.3{\%} in other (nonhome, nonschool) locations, and 20.6{\%} near home or school. Youth had 10 more minutes (30{\%} more) of overall MVPA on school days than on nonschool days. However, the percentage of location time spent in MVPA was lowest at school (4.8{\%} on school days) and highest near home and near school (9.5{\%}-10.4{\%}). Girls had 2.6 to 5.5 fewer minutes per day of MVPA than boys in all locations except near school.

CONCLUSIONS: Although a majority of adolescents' physical activity occurred at school, the low proportion of active time relative to the large amount of time spent at school suggests potential for increasing school-based activity. Increasing time spent in the neighborhood appears promising for increasing overall physical activity, because a high proportion of neighborhood time was active. Increasing youth physical activity to support metabolic health requires strategies for increasing use of physical activity-supportive locations (eg, neighborhoods) and environmental and program improvements in unsupportive locations (eg, schools, homes).},

When the subject wore the devices while walking, the location of the devices differed by about 8 m on average between any two device combinations involving the four devices. The distance between the coordinates logged by the devices decreased when the devices were carried with their antennas facing the sky. All the devices showed similar routes when they were used in a car. All the devices except the Forerunner had satisfactory signal reception when they were worn and when they were carried in the car.

The objectives were to examine differences in objectively-measured physical activity and sedentary behavior across objectively-determined types of locations in Latino preschool-aged children; and determine whether the differences in physical activity by location were greater in children of parents with higher neighborhood-safety perceptions and physical activity-supportive parenting practices. Methods: An observational field study was conducted in Houston (Texas, USA) from August 2011 to April 2012. A purposive sample of Latino children aged 3-5 years and one of their parents (n = 84) were recruited from Census block groups in Houston (Texas) stratified by objectively-assessed high vs. low traffic and crime safety. Seventy-three children provided valid data. Time spent outdoors/indoors tagged with geographic locations was coded into location types based on objective data collected using Global Positioning Systems units that children wore {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} 8 hr/day for a week. Physical activity parenting practices, perceived neighborhood-safety, and demographics were reported by parents. Time spent in sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was measured based on objective data collected using accelerometers (motion sensors) that children wore {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} 8 hr/day for a week. Results: The odds of children engaging in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were 43 {\%} higher when outdoors than indoors (95 {\%} confidence interval: 1.30, 1.58), and the odds of being sedentary were 14 {\%} lower when outdoors compared to indoors (95 {\%} confidence intervals: 0.81, 0.91). This difference depended on parental neighborhood-safety perceptions and parenting practices. Children were most active in parks/playgrounds (30 {\%} of the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) and least active in childcare/school settings (8 {\%} of the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity). Conclusions: Objectively-assessed time spent in specific locations is correlated with physical activity and sedentary behavior in Latino preschoolers. Interventions and policies should identify ways to engage Latino preschool-aged children in more physical activity and less sedentary behavior while in childcare, and encourage parents to spend more time with their young children in parks/playgrounds and other safe outdoor places.},

abstract = {While public policies seek to promote active transportation, there is a lack of information on the social and environmental factors associated with the adoption of active transportation modes. Moreover, despite the consensus on the importance of identifying obesogenic environmental factors, most published studies only take into account residential neighborhoods in the definition of exposures. There are at least three major reasons for incorporating daily mobility in public health research: (i) to identify specific population groups, including socially disadvantaged populations, who experience mobility or spatial accessibility deficits; (ii) to study the environmental determinants of transportation habits and investigate the complex relationships between transportation (as a source of physical activity, pollutants, and accidents) and physical activity and health; and (iii) to improve the assessment of spatial accessibility to resources and exposure to environmental hazards by accounting for daily trajectories for a better understanding of their health effects. There is urgent need to develop novel methods to better assess daily mobility. The RECORD Study relies on (i) an electronic survey of regular mobility to assess the chronic exposure to environmental conditions over a relatively long period, and (ii) Global Positioning System tracking to evaluate precisely acute environmental exposures over a much shorter period. The present article argues that future research should combine these two approaches. Gathering scientific evidence on the relationships between the environments, mobility/transportation, and health should allow public health and urban planning decision makers to better take into account the individual and environmental barriers to the adoption of active transportation and to define innovative intervention strategies addressing obesogenic environments to reduce disparities in excess weight. ?? 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {BackgroundAccurate information is lacking on the extent of transportation as a source of physical activity, on the physical activity gains from public transportation use, and on the extent to which population shifts in the use of transportation modes could increase the percentage of people reaching official physical activity recommendations.MethodsIn 2012 inverted question mark2013, 234 participants of the RECORD GPS Study (French Paris region, median age inverted question mark= inverted question mark58) wore a portable GPS receiver and an accelerometer for 7 consecutive days and completed a 7-day GPS-based mobility survey (participation rate inverted question mark= inverted question mark57.1{\%}). Information on transportation modes and accelerometry data aggregated at the trip level [number of steps taken, energy expended, moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and sedentary time] were available for 7,644 trips. Associations between transportation modes and accelerometer-derived physical activity were estimated at the trip level with multilevel linear models.ResultsParticipants spent a median of 1h58min per day in transportation (8.2{\%} of total time). Thirty-eight per-cent of steps taken, 31{\%} of energy expended, and 33{\%} of MVPA over 7 days were attributable to transportation. Walking and biking trips but also public transportation trips with all four transit modes examined were associated with greater steps, MVPA, and energy expenditure when compared to trips by personal motorized vehicle. Two simulated scenarios, implying a shift of approximately 14{\%} and 33{\%} of all motorized trips to public transportation or walking, were associated with a predicted 6 point and 13 point increase in the percentage of participants achieving the current physical activity recommendation.ConclusionsCollecting data with GPS receivers, accelerometers, and a GPS-based electronic mobility survey of activities and transportation modes allowed us to investigate relationships between transportation modes and physical activity at the trip level. Our findings suggest that an increase in active transportation participation and public transportation use may have substantial impacts on the percentage of people achieving physical activity recommendations.},

abstract = {As their most critical limitation, neighborhood and health studies published to date have not taken into account nonresidential activity places where individuals travel in their daily lives. However, identifying low-mobility populations residing in low-resource environments, assessing cumulative environmental exposures over multiple activity places, and identifying specific activity locations for targeting interventions are important for health promotion. Daily mobility has not been given due consideration in part because of a lack of tools to collect locational information on activity spaces. Thus, the first aim of the current article is to describe VERITAS (Visualization and Evaluation of Route Itineraries, Travel Destinations, and Activity Spaces), an interactive web mapping application that can geolocate individuals' activity places, routes between locations, and relevant areas such as experienced or perceived neighborhoods. The second aim is to formalize the theoretic grounds of a contextual expology as a subdiscipline to better assess the spatiotemporal configuration of environmental exposures. Based on activity place data, various indicators of individual patterns of movement in space (spatial behavior) are described. Successive steps are outlined for elaborating variables of multiplace environmental exposure (collection of raw locational information, selection/exclusion of locational data, defining an exposure area for measurement, and calculation). Travel and activity place network areas are discussed as a relevant construct for environmental exposure assessment. Finally, a note of caution is provided that these measures require careful handling to avoid increasing the magnitude of confounding (selective daily mobility bias). ?? 2012 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

Background: Because physical activity researchers are increasingly using objective portable devices, this review describes the current state of the technology to assess physical activity, with a focus on specific sensors and sensor properties currently used in monitors and their strengths and weaknesses. Additional sensors and sensor properties desirable for activity measurement and best practices for users and developers also are discussed. Best Practices: We grouped current sensors into three broad categories for objectively measuring physical activity: associated body movement, physiology, and context. Desirable sensor properties for measuring physical activity and the importance of these properties in relationship to specific applications are addressed, and the specific roles of transducers and data acquisition systems within the monitoring devices are defined. Technical advancements in sensors, microcomputer processors, memory storage, batteries, wireless communication, and digital filters have made monitors more usable for subjects (smaller, more stable, and longer running time) and for researchers (less costly, higher time resolution and memory storage, shorter download time, and user-defined data features). Future Directions: Users and developers of physical activity monitors should learn about the basic properties of their sensors, such as range, accuracy, and precision, while considering the data acquisition/filtering steps that may be critical to data quality and may influence the desirable measurement outcome(s).},

abstract = {Speeding increases crash risk and resulting injury severity. Older drivers are at increased risk of injury due to frailty, at increased risk of crashing due to slower reaction times, and have less agility judging time and distance compared to younger drivers. However, there is little objective evidence about older drivers’ speeding behaviour. Cross-sectional data from older drivers living in the suburban outskirts of Sydney, Australia, were used to determine the proportion of drivers involved in speed events, and examine factors that may influence this behaviour. Driving speed was estimated in approximately one-second intervals using Global Positioning System (GPS) location. Speed events were defined as driving 1km/h or more, with 3{\%} tolerance, above a single speed limit, averaged over 30-s of travel. Driving data from one-week were recorded for 344 participants aged 75–94years (median 80). The majority of participants (78{\%}) were involved in a speed event. Speed events per participant ranged from zero to 186 (median 8). Younger participants, those living in rural areas, and those driving on familiar roads closer to home were more likely to be involved in speed events adjusted for distance driven. In addition, rural residents were more likely to be involved in speed events when they had not been a driver involved in a crash during the previous year compared to those involved in a crash. Measures of visual and cognitive function did not predict involvement with speed events per distance (p>0.2). These findings are important for policy-makers and researchers addressing older drivers’ speeding to reduce the incidence of crashes and resulting fatalities and injuries. As no evidence was found for speeding being associated with functional decline, countermeasures to address speeding for other drivers seem likely to be relevant to older drivers.},

However, motorcycles can emit significant amounts of air pollutants; therefore, the emission characteristics and driving patterns of motorcycles are necessary baseline information for the implementation of control measures for motorcycles in urban areas. The selected motorcycles were equipped with global positioning systems (GPS) to obtain speed-time data for determination of the characteristics of real-world driving parameters, and an on-board exhaust gas analyser with data logger was employed to determine the instantaneous concentration of regulated air pollutants from motorcycle exhaust. Results indicated that the time proportions of acceleration, cruising, and deceleration are different from those of the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) driving cycle, and the time percentages of acceleration and deceleration of the ECE cycle are much less than those in Taichung city. In general, the emission factors of the Taichung motorcycle driving cycle (TMDC) were higher HC and lower NOx emission than those of the ECE cycle. The average fuel consumption of tested motorcycles on three roads during workdays was 5{\%} higher than that on weekends. The fuel consumption in the real-world motorcycle driving cycle was also about 7{\%} higher than that of the ECE cycle, which again indicates that the ECE cycle is unsuitable for measuring fuel consumption in the Taichung metropolitan area. Therefore, understanding the local driving cycle is necessary for developing accurate emission data for air pollution control measures for urban areas. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study developed and tested algorithms to identify outdoor walking trips from portable global positioning system (GPS) units in free-living conditions. Methods: The study included a calibration and a validation phase. For the calibration phase, we determined the best algorithm from 35 person-days of data. Measures of agreement regarding the daily number and duration of diary-reported and GPS-identified trips were used. In the validation phase, the best algorithm was applied to an additional and separate 136 person-days of diary and GPS data. Results: The preferred algorithm in the calibration phase resulted in 90{\%} of trips identified from the GPS data being found in the diary, whereas 81{\%} of trips reported in the diary being found in the GPS data. The preferred algorithm used 1) a maximum 3-min gap between points to define a trip, 2) at least 5 min or more of continuous GPS points, 3) a speed range between 2 and 8.0 km•h, 4) at least 30 m of displacement between the start and end points of a trip, and 5) merged walking trips when the time gap between trips was less than 3 min. With the validation data, substantial agreement between the GPS and the diary was achieved, with 86{\%} of trips identified from the GPS data found in the diary and 77{\%} of trips reported in the diary found in the GPS data. Conclusions: The algorithm identified free-living walking trips of more than 5 min in duration. The ability to identify outdoor walking trips from GPS data can be improved by reducing recording intervals used in the GPS units and monitoring participant compliance. Further research is desirable to determine whether concurrent wearing of an accelerometer may improve the ability to detect walking more accurately. © 2011 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

This study used a body-worn global positioning system (GPS) device to determine the outdoor activity per day performed by this population. Additionally, this study examined the association that mobility, time since injury and injury severity had with levels of outdoor physical activity. Findings: Seventeen people with TBI and 15 control subjects wore a GPS device for between 3-7 days to monitor their outdoor activity. Based on the individual's location and speed of movement the outdoor physical activity in minutes per day was derived. Assessments of duration of outdoor activity between groups, and the relationship that duration of outdoor activity had with results on the high-level mobility assessment tool, length of post-traumatic amnesia, and time since injury were performed. No significant (p = 0.153, effect size = 0.26) difference in time spent in outdoor physical activity was observed between the TBI (median[IQR] = 19[3-43] mins) and control (median[IQR] = 50 [18-65] mins) group. Interestingly, 35{\%} of TBI subjects performed {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 10 mins of outdoor activity per day compared to 13{\%} of the control group. The TBI group also recorded three of the four highest values for outdoor physical activity. Higher levels of mobility were associated with more outdoor activity (Spearman's rho = 0.443, p = 0.038). No other significant associations were observed. Conclusions: While preliminary, our results indicate that a sub-group of people with TBI exists who restrict their outdoor activities.

abstract = {Using a sample of English school children, we use accelerometery and global positioning systems to identify whether different intensities of activity (light, moderate, and vigorous) occur in different environments, and whether environments for bouts of moderate to vigorous activity (MVPA) vary from those for non-bout MVPA. We find that land uses such as buildings and roads and pavements were generally used for light activity, whilst green environments such as gardens, parks, grassland and farmland appear supportive of vigorous activity. Built land uses such as hard surface play areas were particularly used for activity of short duration. Future work may consider differentiating light activity from moderate and vigorous, and separating bout and non-bout MVPA to better identify environmental supportiveness for activity in children. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Walking to school is associated with higher levels of physical activity, but the contribution of the journey itself to physical activity before school is unknown. Purpose: This study combined accelerometer and GPS data to investigate the level and location of physical activity in children walking to school. Methods: Participants were 137 children (aged 11.3??0.3 years) from London, England, measured in June-July 2006. Physical activity was measured by accelerometry, and location was determined with a GPS receiver. Travel mode was self-reported. Accelerometer and GPS data were time-matched to provide activity level and location for each 10-second epoch where both were available. Journeys were mapped in a GIS. Results: Mean accelerometer counts per minute before school (8:00am to 9:00am) were 43{\%} higher in those who walked to school than those traveling by car (878.8??387.6 vs 608.7??264.1 counts per minute [cpm], p<0.001). Eleven percent (4.5 minutes) of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) occurred in this hour, with walkers recording 2.1 minutes more than car travelers (p=0.004). Children followed direct routes between home and the school playground. Total activity during the walk to school was twice that in the playground (2131.3??1170.7 vs 1089.7??938.6 cpm, p<0.001), with the journey contributing three times as much MVPA as time in the playground. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that the journey to school is purposeful and contributes to higher total physical activity and MVPA in children. Combining accelerometer and GPS data may aid our understanding of the environmental context of physical activity. ?? 2010 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

abstract = {Objective: Affect-regulated exercise ("ARE") is an alternative approach to guide exercise intensity based on feeling of pleasure. The aim of this study was to analyze if overweight/obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) meet the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommendation regarding to exercise intensity to improve health status during a single bout of "ARE". Methods: A sample of 14 overweight/obese women with PCOS (18-34 years) performed a single bout of "ARE" (40 min of aerobic exercise on outdoor track). The Feeling Scale (FS) was used to guide "ARE" intensity/pace maintaining an affective valence between "good" and "very good" during all time. Heart rate (HR), speed, {\%} of HR at first and second ventilatory threshold (VT1 and VT2) and time spent at moderate (64-76{\%} of HRmax) and vigorous (77-95{\%} of HRmax) intensity during "ARE" were measured with a global positioning system (GPS) device. Results: Volunteers exercised at 73{\%} (68-78{\%}) of HRmax, 5.8 (5.2-6.2) km/h, 93.4{\%} of HR at VT1 (89.3-98.2) and 80.5{\%} of HR at VT2 (75.3-84.6) and spent {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}80{\%} of time at moderate intensity. Conclusions: Overweight/obese women with PCOS met the ACSM recommendation regarding exercise intensity to improve health status when exercised between "good" and "very good" of FS. Thus, "ARE" may be an interesting approach to be used in clinical practice regarding to exercise prescription and/or physical activity advice.},

abstract = {Background. Active commuting may help to increase adults' physical activity levels. However, estimates of its energy cost are derived from a small number of studies which are laboratory-based or use self-reported measures. Methods. Adults working in Cambridge (UK) recruited through a predominantly workplace-based strategy wore combined heart rate and movement sensors and global positioning system (GPS) devices for one week, and completed synchronous day-by-day travel diaries in 2010 and 2011. Commuting journeys were delineated using GPS data, and metabolic intensity (standard metabolic equivalents; MET) was derived and compared between journey types using mixed-effects linear regression. Results. 182 commuting journeys were included in the analysis. Median intensity was 1.28 MET for car journeys; 1.67 MET for bus journeys; 4.61 MET for walking journeys; 6.44 MET for cycling journeys; 1.78 MET for journeys made by car in combination with walking; and 2.21 MET for journeys made by car in combination with cycling. The value for journeys made solely by car was significantly lower than those for all other journey types (p {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.04). On average, 20{\%} of the duration of journeys incorporating any active travel (equating to 8 min) was spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Conclusions. We have demonstrated how GPS and activity data from a free-living sample can be used simultaneously to provide objective estimates of commuting energy expenditure. On average, incorporating walking or cycling into longer journeys provided over half the weekly recommended activity levels from the commute alone. This may be an efficient way of achieving physical activity guidelines and improving population health. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {There is limited information regarding the validity and reliability of global positioning system (GPS) devices for measuring movement during team sports. The aim of this study was to assess the validity and intra-model reliability of different GPS devices for quantifying high-intensity, intermittent exercise performance. Two moderately trained mates each completed eight bouts of a standard circuit that consisted of six laps around a 128.5-m course involving intermittent exercise. Distance and speed were collected concurrently at 1-Hz using six GPS devices (2 SPI-10, 2 SPI Elite and 2 WiSPI, GPSports, Canberra, Australia). Performance measures were: (1) total distance covered for each bout and each lap; (2) high-intensity running distance ({\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}14.4 km h(-1), HIR); very high-intensity running distance ({\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}20 km h(-1), VHIR) during each bout. Peak speed was also measured during a 20-m sprint at the start of each lap of the circuit (N=192). Actual distance was measured using a measuring tape. Mean (+/- SD) circuit total distance was significantly different between each of the GPS devices (P{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}0.001); however, all devices were within 5 m of the actual lap distance and had a good level of reliability (coefficient of variation (CV) {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}5{\%}). The CV for total distance (3.6-7.1{\%}) and peak speed (2.3-5.8{\%}) was good-to-moderate, but poor for HIR (11.2-32.4{\%}) and VHIR (11.5-30.4{\%}) for all GPS devices. These results show that the GPS devices have an acceptable level of accuracy and reliability for total distance and peak speeds during high-intensity, intermittent exercise, but may not be provide reliable measures for higher intensity activities.

abstract = {Objectives: To compare the metabolic power demands between positional groups, and examine temporal changes in these parameters during Australian Football match-play. Design: Longitudinal observational study. Methods: Global positioning system data were collected from 39 Australian Football players from the same club during 19 Australian Football League competition games over two seasons. A total of 342 complete match samples were obtained for analysis. Players were categorised into one of six positional groups: tall backs, mobile backs, midfielders, tall forwards, mobile forwards and rucks. Instantaneous raw velocity data obtained from the global positioning system units was exported to a customised spreadsheet which provided estimations of both speed-based (e.g. total and high-speed running distance) and derived metabolic power and energy expenditure variables (e.g. average metabolic power, high-power distance, total energy expenditure). Results: There were significant differences between positional groups for both speed-based and metabolic power indices, with midfielders covering more total and high-speed distance, as well as greater average and overall energy expenditure compared to other positions (all p<. 0.001). There were reductions in total, high-speed, and high-power distance, as well as average metabolic power throughout the match (all p<. 0.001). Conclusions: Positional differences exist for both metabolic power and traditional running based variables. Generally, midfielders, followed by mobile forwards and mobile backs had greater activity profiles compared to other position groups. We observed that the reductions in most metabolic power variables during the course of the match are comparable to traditional running based metrics. This study demonstrates that metabolic power data may contribute to our understanding of the physical demands of Australian Football.},

abstract = {There is little information describing the match running demands of elite-level Australian Rules Football (AF). The aims of this study were to examine: (1) match running demands; and (2) the influence of periods of increased physical activity on subsequent running performance in the Australian Football League. Time-motion analyses were performed 1-9 times per player from 16 professional AF players from the same club during games in 2005-2007, using portable global positioning systems during 65 matches. Game movements (standing, walking, jogging, running, higher-speed running, and sprinting) and distances (total distance covered [TD]; low-intensity activity [LIA, distance <14.4kmh-1]; and, high-intensity running distance [HIR, distance>14.4kmh-1]) were collected. The influence of the first half physical activities on second half activities, and each quarter on the subsequent quarter were analysed. The mean (±SD) TD and HIR distance covered during the games were 12,939±1145m and 3880±663m respectively. There were reductions in TD in the second (-7.3{\%}), third (-5.5{\%}) and fourth (-10.7{\%}) quarters compared to the first quarter (p<0.01). The HIR was reduced after the first quarter (p<0.001). Players that covered larger TD or HIR during the first half or quarter decreased distance in the next half and quarter, respectively (p<0.001). These results show that a reduction in exercise intensity is inevitable during an AF match and that higher intensity activities reduce towards the end of games. High average speed during each half or quarter also affects subsequent running performance in elite-level AF. © 2009 Sports Medicine Australia.},

Greenway use data were collected through direct observation, making multiple passes over two city greenways and recording the location of users with a Global Positioning System device. The distribution of uses was then examined with land-use data using geographic information systems to determine if use was heaviest on segments of the greenway adjacent to areas with distinct land-use characteristics. The study reveals that use is heaviest on sections of the greenway that intersect parks and on greenway segments in downtown areas where there is a concentration of commercial land use. Use is also significant on segments that connect parks to the downtown when these two land uses are separated by relatively short distances.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To explore and deepen understanding of factors influencing driving exposure for older drivers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Baseline data on function and driving exposure from 1 week of driving were evaluated. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 380 drivers aged 75 and older, residing in northwest Sydney, was recruited. Participants were required to be the primary drivers of their own vehicle. MEASUREMENTS: Driver function was evaluated using the DriveSafe and DriveAware clinic-based assessments to measure visual attention to the driving environment and awareness of driving ability. Demographic information was obtained through interview. An in-vehicle monitoring device with data logger and GPS receiver, was used to measure driving exposure in 362 of 380 participants' vehicles. Driving exposure outcomes were total distance driven, furthest distance traveled from home, and average trip length. Factors influencing these exposure outcomes were analyzed using generalized linear regression. RESULTS: Drivers typically drove 100 km in local and surrounding areas during the week. Function was predictive of all driving exposure outcomes. Drivers with lower levels of function drove fewer kilometers and took shorter trips closer to home. Age, health status, and personal circumstance (e.g., rural residence) also influenced exposure, but sex did not. CONCLUSION: Using objective measures, this study provides evidence that function, age, health status, and personal circumstance influence driving exposure of older drivers. Understanding how older people use driving to preserve their independence is important for exploring safe driving strategies for older people.© 2015, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2015, The American Geriatrics Society.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact forces of collision events during both attack and defence within elite rugby league match-play, and to compare the collision profiles between playing positions. METHODS: Twenty-six elite rugby league players participated in this study. Player collisions were recorded using an integrated accelerometer within global positioning system units (SPI-Pro X, GPSports). Impact forces of collisions in attack (hit-ups) and defence (tackles) were analysed from 359 files from outside backs (n=78), adjustables (n=97), wide-running forwards (n=136) and hit-up forwards (n=48) over one National Rugby League season. RESULTS: Hit-up forwards were involved in 0.8 collisions per minute, significantly greater than all other positional groups (wide-running forwards p=0.050, adjustables p=0.042 and outside backs p=0.000). Outside backs experienced 25{\%} fewer collisions per minute than hit-up forwards. Hit-up forwards experienced a collision within the two highest classifications of force (≥10G) every 2.5 minutes of match-play compared to one every 5 and 9 minutes for adjustables and outside backs, respectively. Hit-up forwards performed 0.5 tackles per minute of match-play, five times that of outside backs (ES=1.90; 95{\%} CI (0.26,3.16)) and 0.2 hit-ups per minute of match-play, twice as many as adjustables. CONCLUSION: During a rugby league match, players are exposed to a significant number of collision events. Positional differences exist with hit-up and wide-running forwards experiencing greater collision events than adjustables and outside backs. Although these results may be unique to the individual team's defensive and attacking play strategies, they are indicative of the significant collision profiles in professional rugby league.},

abstract = {Use of Global positioning system (GPS) technology in team sport permits measurement of player position, velocity, and movement patterns. GPS provides scope for better understanding of the specific and positional physiological demands of team sport and can be used to design training programs that adequately prepare athletes for competition with the aim of optimizing on-field performance. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the depth and scope of reported GPS and microtechnology measures used within individual sports in order to present the contemporary and emerging themes of GPS application within team sports. A systematic review of the application of GPS technology in team sports was conducted. We systematically searched electronic databases from earliest record to June 2012. Permutations of key words included GPS; male and female; age 12-50 years; able-bodied; and recreational to elite competitive team sports. The 35 manuscripts meeting the eligibility criteria included 1,276 participants (age 11.2-31.5 years; 95 {\%} males; 53.8 {\%} elite adult athletes). The majority of manuscripts reported on GPS use in various football codes: Australian football league (AFL; n = 8), soccer (n = 7), rugby union (n = 6), and rugby league (n = 6), with limited representation in other team sports: cricket (n = 3), hockey (n = 3), lacrosse (n = 1), and netball (n = 1). Of the included manuscripts, 34 (97 {\%}) detailed work rate patterns such as distance, relative distance, speed, and accelerations, with only five (14.3 {\%}) reporting on impact variables. Activity profiles characterizing positional play and competitive levels were also described. Work rate patterns were typically categoriszed into six speed zones, ranging from 0 to 36.0 km center dot h(-1), with descriptors ranging from walking to sprinting used to identify the type of activity mainly performed in each zone. With the exception of cricket, no standardized speed zones or definitions were observed within or between sports. Furthermore, speed zone criteria often varied widely within (e.g. zone 3 of AFL ranged from 7 to 16 km center dot h(-1)) and between sports (e.g. zone 3 of soccer ranged from 3.0 to {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 13 km center dot h(-1) code). Activity descriptors for a zone also varied widely between sports (e.g. zone 4 definitions ranged from jog, run, high velocity, to high-intensity run). Most manuscripts focused on the demands of higher intensity efforts (running and sprint) required by players. Body loads and impacts, also summarized into six zones, showed small variations in descriptions, with zone criteria based upon grading systems provided by GPS manufacturers. This systematic review highlights that GPS technology has been used more often across a range of football codes than across other team sports. Work rate pattern activities are most often reported, whilst impact data, which require the use of microtechnology sensors such as accelerometers, are least reported. There is a lack of consistency in the definition of speed zones and activity descriptors, both within and across team sports, thus underscoring the difficulties encountered in meaningful comparisons of the physiological demands both within and between team sports. A consensus on definitions of speed zones and activity descriptors within sports would facilitate direct comparison of the demands within the same sport. Meta-analysis from systematic review would also be supported. Standardization of speed zones between sports may not be feasible due to disparities in work rate pattern activities.},

abstract = {Locational data, logged on portable GPS units and matched with accelerometer data, was used to examine associations of the built environment with physical activity and sedentary behaviors of adolescent females. In a sample of 293 adolescent females aged 15 to 18 years old in Minneapolis and San Diego, the built environment around each GPS point and its corresponding sedentary, light, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity was examined using random intercept multinomial logistic regression models. The odds of higher physical activity intensity (3-level outcome: sedentary, light, MVPA) were higher in places with parks, schools, and high population density, during weekdays, and lower in places with more roads and food outlets. Understanding the places where physical activity and sedentary behaviors occur appears to be a promising strategy to clarify relationships and inform policy aimed at increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviors. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Traditional methods of exposure assessment in epidemiological studies often fail to integrate important information on activity patterns, which may lead to bias, loss of statistical power, or both in health effects estimates. Novel sensing technologies integrated with mobile phones offer potential to reduce exposure measurement error. We sought to demonstrate the usability and relevance of the CalFit smartphone technology to track person-level time, geographic location, and physical activity patterns for improved air pollution exposure assessment. We deployed CalFit-equipped smartphones in a free-living population of 36 subjects in Barcelona, Spain. Information obtained on physical activity and geographic location was linked to space-time air pollution mapping. We found that information from CalFit could substantially alter exposure estimates. For instance, on average travel activities accounted for 6{\%} of people's time and 24{\%} of their daily inhaled NO2. Due to the large number of mobile phone users, this technology potentially provides an unobtrusive means of enhancing epidemiologic exposure data at low cost. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Eighteen men (age 71.2 +/- 4.4 yr, BMI 27.3 +/- 2.3; M +/- SD) completed a graded treadmill test. During golfing and lawn-mowing field tests, oxygen consumption and walking velocity and distance were measured using a portable metabolic system and global positioning system receiver. The net energy costs of golfing and lawn mowing were 310 and 246 kcal, respectively. The average intensities in metabolic equivalents of golfing and lawn mowing were 2.8 +/- 0.5 and 5.5 +/- 0.9, respectively.

abstract = {Advances in mobile technology have led to the emergence of the smartphone, a new class of device with more advanced connectivity features that have quickly made it a constant presence in our lives. Smartphones are equipped with comparatively advanced computing capabilities, a global positioning system (GPS) receivers, and sensing capabilities (i.e., an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and more recently magnetometer and barometer) which can be found in wearable ambulatory monitors (WAMs). As a result, algorithms initially developed for WAMs that count steps (i.e., pedometers); gauge physical activity levels; indirectly estimate energy expenditure and monitor human movement can be utilised on the smartphone. These algorithms may enable clinicians to close the loop by prescribing timely interventions to improve or maintain wellbeing in populations who are at risk of falling or suffer from a chronic disease whose progression is linked to a reduction in movement and mobility. The ubiquitous nature of smartphone technology makes it the ideal platform from which human movement can be remotely monitored without the expense of purchasing, and inconvenience of using, a dedicated WAM. In this paper, an overview of the sensors that can be found in the smartphone are presented, followed by a summary of the developments in this field with an emphasis on the evolution of algorithms used to classify human movement. The limitations identified in the literature will be discussed, as well as suggestions about future research directions.},

abstract = {Rugby league coaches often prescribe training to replicate the demands of competition. The intensities of running drills are often monitored in comparison with absolute match-play measures. Such measures may not be sensitive enough to detect fluctuations in intensity across a match or to differentiate between positions. Purpose: To determine the position-and duration-specific run-ning intensities of rugby league competition, using a moving-average method, for the prescription and monitoring of training. Methods: Data from a 15-Hz global positioning system (GPS) were collected from 32 professional rugby league players across a season. The velocity–time curve was analyzed using a rolling-average method, where maximum values were calculated for 10 different durations, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 min, for each player across each match. Results: There were large differ-ences between the 1-and 2-min rolling averages and all other rolling-average durations. Smaller differences were observed for rolling averages of greater duration. Fullbacks maintained a greater velocity than outside backs and middle and edge forwards over the 1-and 2-min rolling averages (ES 0.8–1.2, P < .05). For rolling averages 3 min and greater, the running demands of the fullbacks were greater than those of the middle forwards and outside backs (ES 1.1–1.4, P < .05). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the running demands of rugby league fluctuate vastly across a match. Fullbacks were the only position to exhibit a greater running intensity than any other position, and therefore training prescription should reflect this.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active transport to school is associated with higher levels of physical activity in children. Promotion of active transport has therefore gained attention as a potential target to increase children's physical activity levels. Recent studies have recognized that the distance between home and school is an important predictor for active travel among children. These studies did not yet use the promising global positioning system (GPS) methods to objectively assess active transport. This study aims to explore active transport to school in relation to the distance between home and school among a sample of Dutch elementary school children, using GPS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Seventy-nine children, aged 6-11 years, were recruited in six schools that were located in five cities in the Netherlands. All children were asked to wear a GPS receiver for one week. All measurements were conducted between December 2008 and April 2009. Based on GPS recordings, the distance of the trips between home and school were calculated. In addition, the mode of transport (i.e., walking, cycling, motorized transport) was determined using the average and maximum speed of the GPS tracks. Then, proportion of walking and cycling trips to school was determined in relation to the distance between home and school.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Out of all school trips that were recorded (n = 812), 79.2{\%} were classified as active transport. On average, active commuting trips were of a distance of 422 meters with an average speed of 5.2 km/hour. The proportion of walking trips declined significantly at increased school trip distance, whereas the proportion of cycling trips ($\beta$ = 1.23, p < 0.01) and motorized transport ($\beta$ = 3.61, p < 0.01) increased. Almost all GPS tracks less than 300 meters were actively commuted, while of the tracks above 900 meters, more than half was passively commuted.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In the current research setting, active transport between home and school was the most frequently used mode of travel. Increasing distance seems to be associated with higher levels of passive transport. These results are relevant for those involved in decisions on where to site schools and residences, as it may affect healthy behavior among children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children's current physical activity levels are disturbingly low when compared to recommended levels. This may be changed by intervening in the school environment. However, at present, it is unclear to what extent schoolyard physical activity contributes towards reaching the daily physical activity guideline. The aim of this study was to examine how long and at what intensity children are physically active at the schoolyard during different time segments of the day. Moreover, the contribution of schoolyard physical activity towards achieving the recommended guideline for daily physical activity was investigated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Children (n=76) between the age of 6-11 years were recruited in six different schools in five cities (>70.000 residents) in the Netherlands. During the weekdays of a regular school week, childrens' physical activity and location were measured with ActiGraph accelerometers and Travelrecorder GPS receivers. Data was collected from December 2008 to April 2009. From the data, the amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on and outside the schoolyard was established. Moreover, the percentage of MVPA on the schoolyard was compared between the following segments of the day: pre-school, school, school recess, lunch break and post-school. Differences between boys and girls were compared using linear and logistic mixed-effects models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: On average, children spent 40.1 minutes/day on the schoolyard. During this time, boys were more active on the schoolyard, with 27.3{\%} of their time spent as MVPA compared to 16.7{\%} among girls (OR=2.11 [95{\%} CI 1.54 - 2.90]). The children were most active on the schoolyard during school recess, during which boys recorded 39.5{\%} and girls recorded 23.4{\%} of the time as MVPA (OR=2.55 [95{\%} CI: 1.69 - 3.85]). Although children were only present at the schoolyard for 6.1{\%} of the total reported time, this time contributed towards 17.5{\%} and 16.8{\%} of boys' and girls' minutes of MVPA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: On the schoolyard, children's physical activity levels are higher than on average over the whole day. Physical activity levels are particularly high during school recess. The school environment seems to be an important setting for improving children's physical activity levels. Further research on the facilitators of these high activity levels may provide targets for further promotion of physical activity among children.},

Sixty percent of the cyclists rode for more than 150 minutes per week during the study and nearly all of the bicycling was for utilitarian purposes, not exercise. A disproportionate share of the bicycling occurred on streets with bicycle lanes, separate paths, or bicycle boulevards.

Methods: This natural experiment study uses data from a longitudinal panel of adults with children (n = 353) in Portland, OR. Activity and active transportation outcomes were measured with GPS and accelerometers worn for up to 5. days in 2010-11 and 2012-13. The effect of the treatment was estimated using difference in differences estimation and multivariate regression models. Results: In five of the seven models, the interaction term was not significant, indicating that after controlling for the main effects of time and exposure separately, there was no correlation between being in a treatment area and minutes of moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day, bicycling > 10 min, walking > 20 min, minutes of walking (if > 20), or making a bike trip. Significant covariates included rain, being female, living closer to downtown, and attitudes towards bicycling, walking, and car safety. Conclusion: This study could not confirm an increase in physical activity or active transportation among adults with children living near newly installed bicycle boulevards.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To present the design and pilot test results of a continuous multi-sensor monitoring system of real-world physiological conditions and daily life (activities, travel, exercise, and food consumption), culminating in a Web-based graphical decision-support interface. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The system includes a set of wearable sensors wirelessly connected to a "smartphone" with a continuously running software application that compresses and transmits the data to a central server. Sensors include a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, electrocardiogram (ECG), three-axis accelerometer, and continuous blood glucose monitor. A food/medicine diary and prompted recall activity diary were also used. The pilot test involved 40 type 2 diabetic patients monitored over a 72-h period. RESULTS: All but three subjects were successfully monitored for the full study period. Smartphones proved to be an effective hub for managing multiple streams of data but required attention to data compression and battery consumption issues. ECG, accelerometer, and blood glucose devices performed adequately as long as subjects wore them. GPS tracking for a full day was feasible, although significant efforts are needed to impute missing data. Activity detection algorithms were successful in identifying activities and trip modes but could benefit by incorporating accelerometer data. The prompted recall diary was an effective tool for augmenting algorithm results, although subjects reported some difficulties with it. The food and medicine diary was completed fully, although end times and medicine dosages were occasionally missing. CONCLUSIONS: The unique combination of sensors holds promise for increasing accuracy and reducing burden associated with collecting individual-level activity and physiological data under real-world conditions, but significant data processing issues remain. Such data will provide new opportunities to explore the impacts of human geography and daily lifestyle on health at a fine spatial/temporal scale.},

However, the actual impacts of these factors on blood glucose (BG) variation throughout the day have remained relatively unexplored. Continuous blood glucose monitors combined with human activity tracking technologies afford new opportunities for exploration in a naturalistic setting. Data from a study of 40 patients with diabetes is utilized in this paper, including continuously monitored BG, food/medicine intake, and patient activity/location tracked using global positioning systems over a 4-day period. Standard linear regression and more disaggregated time-series analysis using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) are used to explore patient BG variation throughout the day and over space. The ARIMA models revealed a wide variety of BG correlating factors related to specific activity types, locations (especially those far from home), and travel modes, although the impacts were highly personal. Traditional variables related to food intake and medications were less often significant. Overall, the time-series analysis revealed considerable patient-by-patient variation in the effects of geographic and daily lifestyle factors. We would suggest that maps of BG spatial variation or an interactive messaging system could provide new tools to engage patients and highlight potential risk factors.},

abstract = {A growing range of studies have begun to document the health and well-being benefits associated with contact with nature. Most studies rely on generalized self-reports following engagement in the natural environment. The actual in-situ experience during contact with nature, and the environmental features and factors that evoke health benefits have remained relatively unexplored. Smartphones offer a new opportunity to monitor and interact with human subjects during everyday life using techniques such as Experience Sampling Methods (ESM) that involve repeated self-reports of experiences as they occur in-situ. Additionally, embedded sensors in smartphones such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and accelerometers can accurately trace human activities. This paper explores how these techniques can be combined to comprehensively explore the perceived health and well-being impacts of contact with nature. Custom software was developed to passively track GPS and accelerometer data, and actively prompt subjects to complete an ESM survey at regular intervals throughout their visit to a provincial park in Ontario, Canada. The ESM survey includes nine scale questions concerning moods and emotions, followed by a series of open-ended experiential questions that subjects provide recorded audio responses to. Pilot test results are used to illustrate the nature, quantity and quality of data obtained. Participant activities were clearly evident from GPS maps, including especially walking, cycling and sedate activities. From the ESM surveys, participants reported an average of 25 words per question, taking an average of 15 s to record them. Further qualitative analysis revealed that participants were willing to provide considerable insights into their experiences and perceived health impacts. The combination of passive and interactive techniques is sure to make larger studies of this type more affordable and less burdensome in the future, further enhancing the ability to understand how contact with nature enhances health and well-being.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies on physical activity often lack inexpensive, objective, valid, and reproducible tools for measuring physical activity levels of participants. Novel sensing technologies built into smartphones offer the potential to fill this gap.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: We sought to validate estimates of physical activity and determine the usability for large population-based studies of the smartphone-based CalFit software.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A sample of 36 participants from Barcelona, Spain, wore a smartphone with CalFit software and an Actigraph GT3X accelerometer for 5 days. The ease of use (usability) and physical activity measures from both devices were compared, including vertical axis counts (VT) and duration and energy expenditure predictions for light, moderate, and vigorous intensity from Freedson's algorithm. Statistical analyses included (1) Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test for usability measures, (2) Spearman correlation and linear regression for VT counts, (3) concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and (4) Bland-Altman plots for duration and energy expenditure measures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Approximately 64{\%} (23/36) of participants were women. Mean age was 31 years (SD 8) and mean body mass index was 22 kg/m(2) (SD 2). In total, 25/36 (69{\%}) participants recorded at least 3 days with at least 10 recorded hours of physical activity using CalFit. The linear association and correlations for VT counts were high (adjusted R(2)=0.85; correlation coefficient .932, 95{\%} CI 0.931-0.933). CCCs showed high agreement for duration and energy expenditure measures (from 0.83 to 0.91).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The CalFit system had lower usability than the Actigraph GT3X because the application lacked a means to turn itself on each time the smartphone was powered on. The CalFit system may provide valid estimates to quantify and classify physical activity. CalFit may prove to be more cost-effective and easily deployed for large-scale population health studies than other specialized instruments because cell phones are already carried by many people.},

abstract = {Many studies nowadays make the effort of determining personal exposure rather than estimating exposure at the residential address only. While intra-urban air pollution can be modeled quite easily using interpolation methods, estimating exposure in transport is more challenging. The aim of this study is to investigate which factors determine black carbon (BC) concentrations in transport microenvironments. Therefore personal exposure measurements are carried out using portable aethalometers, trip diaries and GPS devices. More than 1500 trips, both by active modes and by motorized transport, are evaluated in Flanders, Belgium. GPS coordinates are assigned to road segments to allow BC concentrations to be linked with trip and road characteristics (trip duration, degree of urbanization, road type, traffic intensity, travel speed and road speed). Average BC concentrations on highways (10.7??g/m3) are comparable to concentrations on urban roads (9.6??g/m3), but levels are significantly higher than concentrations on rural roads (6.1??g/m3). Highways yield higher BC exposures for motorists compared to exposure on major roads and local roads. Overall BC concentrations are elevated at lower speeds (<30km/h) and at speeds above 80km/h, in accordance to vehicle emission functions. Driving on roads with low traffic intensities resulted in lower exposures than driving on roads with higher traffic intensities (from 5.6??g/m3 for roads with less than 500veh/h, up to 12??g/m3 for roads with over 2500veh/h). Traffic intensity proved to be the major explanatory variable for in-vehicle BC exposure, together with timing of the trip and urbanization. For cyclists and pedestrians the range in BC exposure is smaller and models are less predictive; for active modes exposure seems to be influenced by timing and degree of urbanization only. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

However, there has-been limited,evaluation of accuracy and completeness of personal.GPS data. The ability of a GPS data logger to assess location of children during usual activity was evaluated. Data collected for 4 clays from 17 children wearing GPS loggers, recorded every 15s, were evaluated for completeness by time of day during weekend and weekdays, and for accuracy during nighttime at home. Percentage of possible GPS-recorded points and of 5-min intervals with at least one recorded location Were examined. Mean percentage of total possible 15-s interval locations recorded daily was less than 30{\%}. Across participants, the GPS loggers recorded 1-47{\%} of total possible location points on weekends and 1-55{\%} on weekdays. More complete data were measured during travel to school (average 91{\%}). The:percentage of daily 5-min intervals with recorded: data was as high as 53{\%}. At least one location was recorded during 69{\%} of 5:min intervals before school (0630-0800 h), 62{\%} during sthool (0800-1400 h) and 56{\%} after school (1400 1700 h). During night time (0000-0600 h), on average, location was recorded for less than 25{\%} Of 5-min intervals and accuracy was poor. The large proportion of missing data limits the usefulness of GPS logging instruments for population studies. They have potential utility for assessing on-road travel time and route. GPS technology has limitations; and lessons learned from this evaluation can be generalized to the use Of GPS in other research settings.},

J Strength Cond Res 23(9): 2524-2532, 2009-The current study investigated the effects of a pre-cooling intervention on physiological and performance responses to team-sport training in the heat. Seven male lacrosse players performed a familiarization session and 2 randomized, counterbalanced sessions consisting of a 30-minute intermittent-sprint conditioning session. Prior to the sessions, players performed a 20-minute mixed-method, part-body cooling intervention (consisting of cooling vests, cold towels to the neck, and ice packs to the quadriceps) or no cooling intervention. Performance was determined from collection of 1 Hz global positioning system (GPS) data and analyzed for distance and speed. Prior to, during, and following the sessions, core temperature, heart rate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and thermal sensation scale (TSS) were measured; additionally, a venous blood sample was collected before and after each session for measurement of interleukin-6 (IL-6), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein3 (IGF-BP3). Results indicated that a greater distance was covered during the pre-cooling condition (3.35 +/- 0.20 vs. 3.11 +/- 0.13 km; p = 0.05). Further, most of this improvement was evident from a greater distance covered during moderate intensities of 7 to 14 km/h (2.28 +/- 0.18 vs. 2.00 +/- 0.24 km; p = 0.05). Peak speeds and very-high-intensity efforts (20 km/h 6) were not different between conditions (p. 0.05). The increase in core temperature was blunted following cooling, with a lower core temperature throughout the cooling session (38.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 39.3 +/- 0.4 degrees C; p {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.05). However, there were no differences in heart rate, RPE, TSS, IL-6, IGF-1, or IGF-BP3 between conditions (p. 0.05). Accordingly, the use of a mixed-method, part-body cooling intervention prior to an intermittent-sprint training session in the heat can assist in reducing thermoregulatory load and improve aspects of training performance for team sports.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using global positioning system (GPS) methods to understand the spatial context of obesity and hypertension risk among a sample of low-income housing residents in New York City (n = 120). GPS feasibility among participants was measured with a pre- and post-survey as well as adherence to a protocol which included returning the GPS device as well as objective data analysed from the GPS devices. We also conducted qualitative interviews with 21 of the participants. Most of the sample was overweight (26.7{\%}) or obese (40.0{\%}). Almost one-third (30.8{\%}) was pre-hypertensive and 39.2{\%} was hypertensive. Participants reported high ratings of GPS acceptability, ease of use and low levels of wear-related concerns in addition to few concerns related to safety, loss or appearance, which were maintained after the baseline GPS feasibility data collection. Results show that GPS feasibility increased over time. The overall GPS return rate was 95.6{\%}. Out of the total of 114 participants with GPS, 112 (98.2{\%}) delivered at least one hour of GPS data for one day and 84 (73.7{\%}) delivered at least one hour on 7 or more days. The qualitative interviews indicated that overall, participants enjoyed wearing the GPS devices, that they were easy to use and charge and that they generally forgot about the GPS device when wearing it daily. Findings demonstrate that GPS devices may be used in spatial epidemiology research in low-income and potentially other key vulnerable populations to understand geospatial determinants of obesity, hypertension and other diseases that these populations disproportionately experience.},

abstract = {The recent development of global positioning system (GPS) receivers with integrated heart rate (HR) monitoring has provided a new method for estimating the energy expenditure associated with children's movement. The purpose of this feasibility study was to trial a combination of GPS surveillance and HR monitoring in 39 primary-aged children from New Zealand. Spatial location and HR data were recorded during a school lunch break using an integrated GPS/HR receiver (1 Hz). Children averaged a total distance of 1.10 ?? 0.56 km at speeds ranging from 0 to 18.6 km h-1. Activity patterns were characterised by short bursts of moderate to high speeds followed by longer periods of slow speeds. In addition, boys averaged higher speeds than girls (1.77 ?? 0.62 km h-1 and 1.36 ?? 0.50 km h-1, respectively; p = 0.003). The percentage of time spent at 0 km h-1 (stationary) ranged from 0.1{\%} to 21.3{\%} with a mean of 6.4 ?? 4.6{\%}. These data suggest that while children were relatively active during the lunch period, they spent a substantial portion of time engaged in slow or stationary physical activities. Furthermore, associations between HR, average speed, and stationary time demonstrated that children who moved at faster speeds expended more energy than those who moved at slower speeds. We conclude that the combined approach of GPS and HR monitoring is a promising new method for investigating children's play-related energy expenditure. There is also scope to integrate GPS data with geographic information systems to examine where children play and accumulate physical activity. ?? 2008 Sports Medicine Australia.},

abstract = {Introduction: Current methods of assessing routes taken during active transport rely on subjective recall of trip length and barriers encountered enroute or the utilization of objective measures (Geographic Information Systems -[GIS]) that may not represent actual travel patterns. This study examined the utility of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to measure actual routes taken compared with GIS-estimated travel distance and barriers encountered. Methods: Comparisons between GPS and GIS routes were performed for 59 of 75 children who wore a GPS during the journey to school on a single occasion. Home and school addresses were reported by parents and geocoded in GIS. Children were provided with a GPS and were instructed to travel their normal route to and from school. Data were collected between March and November 2005 and exported to the GIS to determine travel distance, number of busy streets crossed, and the ratio of busy streets to the total streets traveled on. Data analysis was performed in August 2006. Results: No differences were observed between GPS-measured journeys to and from school on any of the examined variables. No differences were observed between GIS and GPS measures of travel distance (p>0.05). GIS-estimated travel routes crossed a significantly (p<0.05) higher number of busy streets (GIS: 1.68??0.12 vs GPS: 1.19??0.11) and traveled on a higher ratio of busy streets to total streets traveled on (GIS: 0.46??0.03 vs GPS: 0.35??0.04) (p<0.05) compared with GPS-measured actual travel routes. Conclusions: Geographic Information Systems provides estimates of travel distance similar to GPS-measured actual travel distances. Travel routes estimated by GIS are not representative of actual routes measured by GPS, which indicates that GIS may not provide an accurate estimate of barriers encountered. The continued use of GPS in active transport research in encouraged. ?? 2007 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine test-retest reliability of global positioning system (GPS) units for measuring distance traveled when walking and cycling (AT), and to determine whether GPS unit placement influences accuracy. METHODS: Participants (N = 19) completed two walking and cycling trials at self-selected speeds on a measured 1489-m course wearing two Garmin GPS units, worn in lanyard and waistband placements. GPS estimates of travel distance were compared with actual distance, and test-retest reliability was examined. Data-cleaning protocols were developed to remove signal noise. Results are presented for both raw and cleaned data. RESULTS: For both raw and cleaned data, no significant differences were observed between trials (trial 1 vs trial 2), unit placement (lanyard vs waistband), or AT mode (walk vs cycle) (P ≤ 0.05). Both lanyard and waistband units significantly overestimated distance traveled during walking trials (P ≤ 0.05), but not cycling trials (P ≤ 0.05). The relative technical error of measurement (TEM) of the raw data ranged from 3.74 to 15.51{\%}, and average absolute errors ranged from 5.03 to 8.53{\%} for all trials. A significant position by AT mode interaction was observed for clean data (P < 0.05). Relative TEM for the clean data ranged from 1.42 to 1.98{\%}, and average absolute errors ranged from 0.32 to 1.97{\%}. Intraclass correlations (ICC) were poor to fair for all trials using raw and cleaned data. CONCLUSION: Signal noise during unit initialization may adversely affect unit performance; however, application of data-cleaning procedures to remove data associated with signal noise improves unit ability to measure distance. Results suggest that the lanyard position is the optimal placement for units during data collection. ©2007The American College of Sports Medicine.},

abstract = {Background: GPS receivers are becoming increasingly common as an objective measure of spatio-temporal movement in free-living populations; however, research into the effects of the surrounding physical environment on the accuracy of off-the-shelf GPS receivers is limited. Purpose: The goal of the current study was to (1) determine the static validity of seven portable GPS receiver models under diverse environmental conditions and (2) compare the battery life and signal acquisition times among the models. Methods: Seven GPS models (three units of each) were placed on six geodetic sites subject to a variety of environmental conditions (e. g., open sky, high-rise buildings) on three separate occasions. The observed signal acquisition time and battery life of each unit were compared to advertised specifications. Data were collected and analyzed in June 2012. Results: Substantial variation in positional error was observed among the seven GPS models, ranging from 12.1 +/- 19.6 m to 58.8 +/- 393.2 m when averaged across the three test periods and six geodetic sites. Further, mean error varied considerably among sites: the lowest error occurred at the site under open sky (7.3 +/- 27.7 m), with the highest error at the site situated between high-rise buildings (59.2 +/- 99.2 m). While observed signal acquisition times were generally longer than advertised, the differences between observed and advertised battery life were less pronounced. Conclusions: Results indicate that portable GPS receivers are able to accurately monitor static spatial location in unobstructed but not obstructed conditions. It also was observed that signal acquisition times were generally underestimated in advertised specifications. (Am J Prev Med 2013; 44(2): e19-e29) (C) 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine},

abstract = {Background Although having a greater number of neighborhood parks may be associated with greater overall physical activity in children, information is lacking about the extent to which children actually use parks for physical activity. Purpose This study combined accelerometer, GPS, GIS, and self-report methods to examine neighborhood park availability, perceived proximity, and use for physical activity in children. Methods Low- to middle-income children (aged 8-14 years) (n=135) from suburban communities in Southern California wore an Actigraph accelerometer and GlobalSat BT-335 GPS device across 7 days to measure physical activity and park use, respectively. ArcGIS identified parks within a 500-m residential buffer of children's homes. Parents reported perceptions of neighborhood park proximity through the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Survey (NEWS). Data were collected from March 2009 to December 2010, and analyzed in 2013. Results Fifty-four percent of families lived within 500 m of a park. Of these children, GPS data indicated that 16{\%} used it more than 15 minutes and an additional 11{\%} of children used it between 5 and 15 minutes during the 7-day study period. The odds of extended park use (>15 minutes) increased fourfold when the distance between home and the nearest neighborhood park decreased by 100 m. Additionally, the odds of any park use (>5 minutes) doubled when moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile for park greenness/vegetation density. Conclusions Although children's use of neighborhood parks was generally low, it increased substantially when parks were closer to children's homes and had greater vegetation density. ?? 2014 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

Linear distance between the parent and child for each 30-s epoch was calculated using geographic coordinates from the GPS. Joint behavior was defined as a separation distance less than 50 m between parents and children. RESULTS: On average, during nonschool waking hours, parents and children spent 2.4 +/- 4.1 min.d (mean +/- SD) performing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) together and 92.9 +/- 40.1 min.d in sedentary behavior together. Children engaged in an average of 10 min.d of MVPA during nonschool waking hours when their parent was nearby but not engaging in MVPA. During this same period, parents engaged in 4.6 min.d of MVPA when their child was nearby but not engaging in MVPA. Household income level and the child's age were negatively associated with joint MVPA. Girls engaged in a greater percentage of their total MVPA together with their parent than boys. Girls and older children engaged in more sedentary behavior together with their parent than boys and younger children. Older parents engaged in a greater percentage of their sedentary behavior together with their children than younger parents. CONCLUSIONS: Replacing the time that parents and children spend together in sedentary pursuits with joint physical activity could have health benefits, especially for girls, older children, older parents, and higher income families.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parental factors may play an important role in influencing children's physical activity levels. PURPOSE: This cross-sectional study sought to describe the locations of joint physical activity among parents and children. METHODS: Parent-child pairs (N = 291) wore an Actigraph GT2M accelerometer and GlobalSat BT-335 global positioning systems (GPS) device over the same 7-day period. Children were ages 8-14 years. Joint behavior was defined by a linear separation distance of less than 50 m between parent and child. Land use classifications were assigned to GPS datapoints. RESULTS: Joint physical activity was spread across residential locations (35 {\%}), and commercial venues (24 {\%}), and open spaces/parks (20 {\%}). Obese children and parents performed less joint physical activity in open spaces/parks than under/normal weight children and parents (ps < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding where joint parent-child physical activity naturally occurs may inform location-based interventions to promote these behaviors.},

abstract = {Sports scientists require a thorough understanding of the energy demands of sports and physical activities so that optimal training strategies and game simulations can be constructed. A range of techniques has been used to both directly assess and estimate the physiological and biochemical changes during competition. A fundamental approach to understanding the contribution of the energy systems in physical activity has involved the use of time-motion studies. A number of tools have been used from simple pen and paper methods, the use of video recordings, to sophisticated electronic tracking devices. Depending on the sport, there may be difficulties in using electronic tracking devices because of concerns of player safety. This paper assesses two methods currently used to measure player movement patterns during competition: (1) global positioning technology (GPS) and (2) a computer-based tracking (CBT) system that relies on a calibrated miniaturised playing field and mechanical movements of the tracker. A range of ways was used to determine the validity and reliability of these methods for tracking Australian footballers for distance covered during games. Comparisons were also made between these methods. The results indicate distances measured using CBT overestimated the actual values (measured with a calibrated trundle wheel) by an average of about 5.8{\%}. The GPS system overestimated the actual values by about 4.8{\%}. Distances measured using CBT in experienced hands were as accurate as the GPS technology. Both systems showed relatively small errors in true distances. ?? 2006 Sports Medicine Australia.},

abstract = {Background: Maladaptive behaviors may be more fully understood and efficiently prevented by ambulatory tools that assess people's ongoing experience in the context of their environment. Methods: To demonstrate new field-deployable methods for assessing mood and behavior as a function of neighborhood surroundings (geographical momentary assessment; GMA), we collected time-stamped GPS data and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) ratings of mood, stress, and drug craving over 16 weeks at randomly prompted times during the waking hours of opioid-dependent polydrug users receiving methadone maintenance. Locations of EMA entries and participants' travel tracks calculated for the 12 before each EMA entry were mapped. Associations between subjective ratings and objective environmental ratings were evaluated at the whole neighborhood and 12-h track levels. Results: Participants (N= 27) were compliant with GMA data collection; 3711 randomly prompted EMA entries were matched to specific locations. At the neighborhood level, physical disorder was negatively correlated with negative mood, stress, and heroin and cocaine craving (ps. <. .0001-0335); drug activity was negatively correlated with stress, heroin and cocaine craving (ps .0009-0134). Similar relationships were found for the environments around respondents' tracks in the 12. h preceding EMA entries. Conclusions: The results support the feasibility of GMA. The relationships between neighborhood characteristics and participants' reports were counterintuitive and counter-hypothesized, and challenge some assumptions about how ostensibly stressful environments are associated with lived experience and how such environments ultimately impair health. GMA methodology may have applications for development of individual- or neighborhood-level interventions. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Physical activity has a positive impact on people's well-being, and it may also decrease the occurrence of chronic diseases. Activity recognition with wearable sensors can provide feedback to the user about his/her lifestyle regarding physical activity and sports, and thus, promote a more active lifestyle. So far, activity recognition has mostly been studied in supervised laboratory settings. The aim of this study was to examine how well the daily activities and sports performed by the subjects in unsupervised settings can be recognized compared to supervised settings. The activities were recognized by using a hybrid classifier combining a tree structure containing a priori knowledge and artificial neural networks, and also by using three reference classifiers. Activity data were collected for 68 h from 12 subjects, out of which the activity was supervised for 21 h and unsupervised for 47 h. Activities were recognized based on signal features from 3-D accelerometers on hip and wrist and GPS information. The activities included lying down, sitting and standing, walking, running, cycling with an exercise bike, rowing with a rowing machine, playing football, Nordic walking, and cycling with a regular bike. The total accuracy of the activity recognition using both supervised and unsupervised data was 89{\%} that was only 1{\%} unit lower than the accuracy of activity recognition using only supervised data. However, the accuracy decreased by 17{\%} unit when only supervised data were used for training and only unsupervised data for validation, which emphasizes the need for out-of-laboratory data in the development of activity-recognition systems. The results support a vision of recognizing a wider spectrum, and more complex activities in real life settings.},

METHODS Prospective, population-based, case-control study in the Nandi Hills, a highland area of western Kenya, to identify environmental, sociodemographic and behavioural factors associated with clinical malaria. Data were collected using field observation, a structured questionnaire, and a global positioning system device. RESULTS We interviewed 488 cases of slide-confirmed malaria and 980 age-matched controls. Multivariate analyses associated higher malaria risk with living {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 250 m of a forest [OR = 3.3 (95{\%} CI 1.5, 7.1)], {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 250 m of a swamp [2.8 (1.3, 5.9)], {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 200 m of maize fields [2.0 (1.2, 3.4)], in the absence of trees {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 200 m [1.6 (1.2, 2.2)], on flat land [1.6 (1.2, 2.2)], in houses without ceilings [1.5 (1.1, 2.2)], in houses with a separate kitchen building [1.8 (1.4, 2.3)] and in households where the female household head had no education [1.9 (1.1, 3.1)]. Travelling out of the study site [2.2 (1.2, 4.1)] was also associated with increased risk. CONCLUSIONS In this East African highland area, risk of developing uncomplicated malaria was multifactorial with a risk factor profile similar to that in endemic regions. Households within close proximity to forest and swamp borders are at higher risk of malaria and should be included in indoor residual spraying campaigns.},

abstract = {Background:In rural settings, HIV-infected pregnant women often live significant distances from facilities that provide prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services.Methods:We offered universal maternal combination antiretroviral regimens in 4 pilot sites in rural Zambia. To evaluate the impact of services, we conducted a household survey in communities surrounding each facility. We collected information about HIV status and antenatal service utilization from women who delivered in the past 2 years. Using household Global Positioning System coordinates collected in the survey, we measured Euclidean (i.e., straight line) distance between individual households and clinics. Multivariable logistic regression and predicted probabilities were used to determine associations between distance and uptake of PMTCT regimens.Results:From March to December 2011, 390 HIV-infected mothers were surveyed across four communities. Of these, 254 (65{\%}) had household geographical coordinates documented. One hundred sixty-eight women reported use of a PMTCT regimen during pregnancy including 102 who initiated a combination antiretroviral regimen. The probability of PMTCT regimen initiation was the highest within 1.9 km of the facility and gradually declined. Overall, 103 of 145 (71{\%}) who lived within 1.9 km of the facility initiated PMTCT versus 65 of 109 (60{\%}) who lived farther away. For every kilometer increase, the association with PMTCT regimen uptake (adjusted odds ratio: 0.90, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.82 to 0.99) and combination antiretroviral regimen uptake (adjusted odds ratio: 0.88, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.80 to 0.97) decreased.Conclusions:In this rural African setting, uptake of PMTCT regimens was influenced by distance to health facility.

abstract = {Background: Stroke survivors often experience difficulty returning to activities and places they deem important to their social, leisure, and occupational aspirations. The extent to which stroke survivors return to community mobility and their ability to navigate and access locations they deem meaningful have not been objectively measured. Purpose: We used global positioning system technology (GPSt) to measure the community mobility of a person poststroke, and assess the relationship between GPSt measures and clinical measures of mobility. Methods: The participant was a 56-year-old man who sustained a right pontine stroke. At discharge from rehabilitation, his Six-Minute Walk Test distance was 73 m. He was fitted with a GPS unit and an accelerometer attached to a single belt and instructed to wear the devices at all times when out of bed. After identifying 10 locations that were important to his goals, he was monitored for 5 separate 1-week periods, on the first, fifth, and ninth weeks and at 6 and 12 months after discharge. Results: During the first 10 weeks, he averaged 7.6 target visits (70{\%}) and 26.7 trips perweek. At 1 year, his Six-Minute-Walk distance score was 287.5 m. Accelerometry data revealed that he remained primarily sedentary. Target visits and trips perweek did not change substantially over the course of 1 year, and compliance wearing the GPS unit was variable. Conclusions: Given the limited correlation in gait speed and distance with target attainment and trips, these outcomes likely measure different constructs for this subject. GPSt may offer insights into participation for stroke survivors following rehabilitation.},

The study aims to develop current understanding of how children from low Socio-economic environments within the UK use their surrounding built environments for PA by using advanced technology. The environment was assessed in 96 school children (7-9years) using global positioning system (GPS) monitoring (Garmin Forerunner, 305). In a subsample of 46 children, the environment and PA were assessed using an integrated GPS and heart rate monitor. The percentage of time spent indoor, outdoor, in green and non-green environments along with time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) in indoor and outdoor environments were assessed. A 2-by-2 repeated measures analysis of covariance, controlling for body mass index, BF{\%}, assessed the environmental differences. The findings show that 42{\%} of children from deprived wards of Coventry fail to meet PA guidelines, of which 43{\%} was accumulated during school. Children engaged in more MVPA outdoor than indoor environments (P{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}0.01) and a greater amount of time was spent in non-green environments (P{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}0.01). Increased time outdoors was negatively associated with BF{\%}. In conclusion, outdoor environments are important for health-enhancing PA and reducing fatness in deprived and ethnic children.},

Using data mining mechanisms, we show that this data can be analyzed to uncover daily routines and interesting schemes in the use of public spaces. We first show that our approach supports large-scale analysis of people's whereabouts by comparing behavioral patterns across cities. Then, using Kernel Density Estimation, we present a mechanism to identify popular sport areas in individual cities.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate how 6-year-old school children used their schoolyard during recess and how the yard invited physical activity. Correlates for physical activity were in focus for the investigation. Two different schoolyards, one in the city and one rural, in Southern Norway were chosen for the study. The schoolyards were mapped and the affordances for physical activity described and presented in an ortophoto. The children's movement patterns were recorded with portable global positioning system (GPS) and the level of physical activity monitored by heart rate (HR) applying a Polar pulse watch. GPS and heart rate data were transferred to geographical information systems for further analyses and visualisation. The results indicated physical activity (mean heart rate) to be similar for the children in the two schoolyards. Asphalt areas invited running and soccer play and favoured more physical activity in boys than in girls. The rural schoolyard afforded playing in a little forest, which was more attractive to girls than boys. In both schoolyards the children were physically active in free play at moderate to vigorous levels half the time of a recess period of 40 min. The methods of GPS tracking and HR monitoring seemed to be applicable for this purpose. For further studies with young children the equipment needs adjustments. Experiences from this study recommend more attractive landscapes and facilities that afford increased physical activity in schoolyards. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Mean MP and RD were used to identify peak 2-minute periods of play. Adjacent 2-minute periods (pre and post peak) were compared with peak periods to identify changes in intensity. MP and RD were expressed relative to VO2max and speed at VO2max respectively, and compared in their ability to describe the intensity of peak periods and their temporal occurrence. RESULTS: Small to moderate reductions were present for kinematic (RD; 8.9{\%}) and energetic (MP; 6{\%}) indices between halves. Peak periods (RD = 130 m.min-1; MP =13 W.kg-1) were higher (P < 0.001) than the match average (RD = 94 m.min-1; MP =9.5 W.kg-1), and the pre- and post-peak periods (P < 0.001). RD underestimated the intensity of peak periods compared to MP (Bias: 16{\%}, LoA: +/- 6{\%}). Peak periods identified by RD and MP were temporally dissociated (Bias: 21s, LoA: +/- 212s). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest running intensity varies between and within halves; however the index used will influence both the magnitude and temporal identification of peak periods.},

abstract = {Objectives: No study has investigated the influence of field position and phase of play, on the physical demands of match-play in professional rugby league forwards. We investigated the physical demands placed on forwards in elite rugby league matches, with special reference to how these demands differed between attack and defence, and in different field positions. Design: Cohort study. Methods: Twenty-two rugby league players (26 +/- 3 years) from the same professional club participated in this study. Global positioning system (GPS) analysis was completed during 23 matches. Video footage was synchronised with the GPS files and coded for the time spent in attack and defence, and in one of three different field positions (0-30 m, 31-70 m, 71-100 m). Results: The physical demands of defence were consistently greater than attack. Moderate to large differences (ES = 0.62-1.41) were found between defence and attack for distance covered (109 +/- 16 m/min vs. 82 +/- 12 m/min), low speed distance (104 +/- 15 m/min vs. 78 +/- 11 m/min), frequency of collisions (1.9 +/- 0.7/min vs. 0.8 +/- 0.3/min), and repeated high-intensity effort bouts (1 every 4.9 +/- 5.1 min vs. 1 every 9.4 +/- 6.1 min). The running demands and frequency of repeated high-intensity effort bouts were greater when defending in the opposition's 30 m zone (i.e. 71-100 m), with repeated high-intensity effort bouts also occurring more frequently when defending the team's own try-line and when attacking the opposition's try-line. Conclusions: Specific training drills designed to replicate the attacking and defensive demands of different field positional zones are likely to be effective in preparing players for the most demanding activities that occur in professional rugby league match-play.

abstract = {The present study examined the extent to which game format (possession play, SSG-P and game with regular goals and goalkeepers, SSG-G) and the number of players (5, 7 and 10 a-side) influence the physical demands of small-sided soccer games (SSGs) in elite soccer players. Training data were collected during the in-season period from 26 English Premier League outfield players using global positioning system technology. Total distance covered, distance at different speed categories and maximal speed were calculated. In addition, we focused on changes in velocity by reporting the number of accelerations and decelerations carried out during the SSGs (divided in two categories: moderate and high) and the absolute maximal values of acceleration and deceleration achieved. By taking into account these parameters besides speed and distance values, estimated energy expenditure and average metabolic power and distance covered at different metabolic power categories were calculated. All variables were normalized by time (i.e., 4min). The main findings were that the total distance, distances run at high speed (>14.4kmh-1) as well as absolute maximum velocity, maximum acceleration and maximum deceleration increased with pitch size (10v10>7v7>5v5; p<.05). Furthermore, total distance, very high (19.8-25.2kmh-1) and maximal (>25.2kmh-1) speed distances, absolute maximal velocity and maximum acceleration and deceleration were higher in SSG-G than in SSG-P (p<.001). On the other hand, the number of moderate (2-3ms-2) accelerations and decelerations as well as the total number of changes in velocity were greater as the pitch dimensions decreased (i.e., 5v5>7v7>10v10; p<.001) in both SSG-G and SSG-P. In addition, predicted energy cost, average metabolic power and distance covered at every metabolic power categories were higher in SSG-P compared to SSG-G and in big than in small pitch areas (p<.05). A detailed analysis of these drills is pivotal in contemporary football as it enables an in depth understanding of the workload imposed on each player which consequently has practical implications for the prescription of the adequate type and amount of stimulus during exercise training. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background Understanding factors which may promote walking in mid-life and older adults with mobility impairments is key given the association between physical activity and positive health outcomes. Objective To examine the relationship between active trips and objective measures of the home neighborhood built environment. Methods Global positioning systems (GPS) data collected on 28 adults age 50+ with mobility disabilities were analyzed for active trips from home. Objective and geographic information systems (GIS) derived measures included Walk Score, population density, street connectivity, crime rates, and slope within the home neighborhood. For this cross-sectional observational study, we conducted mean comparisons between participants who took active trips from home and those who did not for the objective measures. Effect sizes were calculated to assess the magnitude of group differences. Results Nine participants (32{\%}) took active trips from home. Walking in the home neighborhood was significantly associated with GIS derived measures (Walk Score, population density, and street density; effect sizes 0.9-1.2). Participants who used the home neighborhood for active trips had less slope within 1 km of home but the difference was not significant (73.5 m ± 22 vs. 100.8 m ± 38.1, p = 0.06, d = 0.8). There were no statistically significant differences in mean scores for crime rates between those with active trips from home and those without. Conclusions The findings provide preliminary evidence that more walkable environments promote active mobility among mid-life and older adults with mobility disabilities. The data suggest that this population can and does use active transportation modes when the built environment is supportive.},

GPS recordings were technically satisfactory in 185 patients (85{\%}) and in 203 (93{\%}) after attempts No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. The highest measured distance between two stops during community walking was 678 m (IQR, 381-1333 m), whereas self-reported maximal walking distance was 250 m (IQR, 150-400 m; P <.001). Walking speed was 3.6 km/h (IQR, 3.1-3.9 km/h), with few variations during the walk. Among the patients who had to stop during the walk, the stop durations were <10 minutes in all but one individual.
Conclusions GPS is applicable for the nonsupervised multicenter recording of walking ability in the community. In the future, it may facilitate objective community-based assessment of walking ability, allow for the adequate monitoring of home-based walking programs, and for the study of new dimensions of walking in PAD patients with intermittent claudication.
Objective This study determined for the first time the clinical applicability of a global positioning system (GPS)-monitored community-based walking ability assessment in a large cohort of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD)
Methods A multicenter study was conducted among PAD patients who complained of intermittent claudication. Patients equipped with a GPS device performed a community-based outdoor walk. We determined the number of technically satisfactory GPS recordings (attempt No. 1). Patients with unsatisfactory GPS recordings were asked to perform a second attempt (attempt No. 2). From the satisfactory recordings obtained after attempts No. 1 and No. 2, we analyzed several GPS parameters to provide clinical information on the patients' walking ability

We investigated PA using novel global positioning system (GPS) tracking individuals with NSCLC and a group of similar-aged healthy individuals. Methods. A prospective cross-sectional multicenter study. Fifty individuals with NSCLC from 3 Australian tertiary hospitals and 35 similar-aged healthy individuals without cancer were included. Individuals with NSCLC were assessed pretreatment. Primary measures were triaxial accelerometery (steps/day) and GPS tracking (outdoor PA behavior). Secondary measures were questionnaires assessing depression, motivation to exercise, and environmental barriers to PA. Between-group comparisons were analyzed using analysis of covariance. Results. Individuals with NSCLC engaged in significantly less PA than similar-aged healthy individuals (mean difference 2363 steps/day, P =.007) and had higher levels of depression (P =.027) and lower motivation to exercise (P =.001). Daily outdoor walking time (P =.874) and distance travelled away from home (P =.883) were not different between groups. Individuals with NSCLC spent less time outdoors in their local neighborhood area (P <.001). A greater number of steps per day was seen in patients who were less depressed (r =.39) or had better access to nonresidential destinations such as shopping centers (r =.25). Conclusion. Global positioning system tracking appears to be a feasible methodology for adult cancer patients and holds promise for use in future studies investigating PA and or lifestyle behaviors.},

abstract = {The extent to which neighbourhood characteristics explain accumulation of health behaviours is poorly understood. We examined whether neighbourhood disadvantage was associated with co-occurrence of behaviour-related risk factors, and how much of the neighbourhood differences in the co-occurrence can be explained by individual and neighbourhood level covariates. Methods: The study population consisted of 60 694 Finnish Public Sector Study participants in 2004 and 2008. Neighbourhood disadvantage was determined using small-area level information on household income, education attainment, and unemployment rate, and linked with individual data using Global Positioning System-coordinates. Associations between neighbourhood disadvantage and co-occurrence of three behaviour-related risk factors (smoking, heavy alcohol use, and physical inactivity), and the extent to which individual and neighbourhood level covariates explain neighbourhood differences in co-occurrence of risk factors were determined with multilevel cumulative logistic regression. Results: After adjusting for age, sex, marital status, and population density we found a dose-response relationship between neighbourhood disadvantage and co-occurrence of risk factors within each level of individual socioeconomic status. The cumulative odds ratios for the sum of health risks comparing the most to the least disadvantaged neighbourhoods ranged between 1.13 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.24) and 1.75 (95{\%} CI, 1.54-1.98). Individual socioeconomic characteristics explained 35{\%}, and neighbourhood disadvantage and population density 17{\%} of the neighbourhood differences in the co-occurrence of risk factors. Conclusions: Co-occurrence of poor health behaviours associated with neighbourhood disadvantage over and above individual's own socioeconomic status. Neighbourhood differences cannot be captured using individual socioeconomic factors alone, but neighbourhood level characteristics should also be considered.},

abstract = {Background/Aims: Hemodialysis (HD) patients are less active than their healthy counterparts and frequently experience poor sleep. Our aims were to objectively quantify activity and sleep quality in HD patients of an urban population and to determine the effect of providing feedback on activity. Methods: Activity parameters and sleep parameters were collected by a commercially available activity tracker in 29 chronic HD patients. Patients in the feedback group were provided with their activity and sleep data during each HD treatment. Questionnaires were administered at the beginning and at the end of the study. Results: On average, patients walked 8,454 steps/day and slept 349 min/night. Only 28{\%} of the patients were sedentary, defined as walking <5,000 steps/day. Providing feedback did not increase the activity in this urban population. Patients walked significantly less on Sundays compared to other days of the week: 7,024 steps on Sundays vs. 8,633 steps on HD days and 8,732 on non-HD days. It was also found that patients experienced poor sleep quality. HD treatments during shift 1 (6 a.m. to 10 a.m.) interfered with sleep patterns. Most patients reported that physical activity became more important to them after the 5-week period. The tracking device was very well accepted. Conclusion: Interventions to increase physical activity on Sundays could improve physical activity levels overall. Prospective studies are necessary to further explore the use of tracking devices to identify patients at risk and to implement targeted interventions.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to quantify the motion demands of match-play in elite U12 to U16 age-group soccer players. Altogether, 112 players from two professional soccer clubs at five age-group levels (U12-U16) were monitored during competitive matches (n = 14) using a 5 Hz non-differential global positioning system (NdGPS). Velocity thresholds were normalized for each age-group using the mean squad times for a flying 10 m sprint test as a reference point. Match performance was reported as total distance, high-intensity distance, very high-intensity distance, and sprint distance. Data were reported both in absolute (m) and relative (m · min(-1)) terms due to a rolling substitute policy. The U15 (1.35 ± 0.09 s) and U16 (1.31 ± 0.06 s) players were significantly quicker than the U12 (1.58 ± 0.10 s), U13 (1.52 ± 0.07 s), and U14 (1.51 ± 0.08 s) players in the flying 10 m sprint test (P < 0.001). The U16 age-group covered significantly more absolute total distance (U16 > U12, U13, U14), high-intensity distance (U16 > U12, U13, U14, U15), very high-intensity distance (U16 > U12, U13), and sprint distance (U16 > U12, U13) than their younger counterparts (P < 0.05). When the data are considered relative to match exposure, few differences are apparent. Training prescription for youth soccer players should consider the specific demands of competitive match-play in each age-group.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The school journey may make an important contribution to children's physical activity and provide exposure to food and physical activity environments. Typically, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have been used to model assumed routes to school in studies, but these may differ from those actually chosen. We aimed to identify the characteristics of children and their environments that make the modelled route more or less representative of that actually taken. We compared modelled GIS routes and actual Global Positioning Systems (GPS) measured routes in a free-living sample of children using varying travel modes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Participants were 175 13-14 yr old children taking part in the Sport, Physical activity and Eating behaviour: Environmental Determinants in Young people (SPEEDY) study who wore GPS units for up to 7 days. Actual routes to/from school were extracted from GPS data, and shortest routes between home and school along a road network were modelled in a GIS. Differences between them were assessed according to length, percentage overlap, and food outlet exposure using multilevel regression models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: GIS routes underestimated route length by 21.0{\%} overall, ranging from 6.1{\%} among walkers to 23.2{\%} for bus users. Among pedestrians food outlet exposure was overestimated by GIS routes by 25.4{\%}. Certain characteristics of children and their neighbourhoods that improved the concordance between GIS and GPS route length and overlap were identified. Living in a village raised the odds of increased differences in length (odds ratio (OR) 3.36 (1.32-8.58)), while attending a more urban school raised the odds of increased percentage overlap (OR 3.98 (1.49-10.63)). However none were found for food outlet exposure. Journeys home from school increased the difference between GIS and GPS routes in terms of food outlet exposure, and this measure showed considerable within-person variation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: GIS modelled routes between home and school were not truly representative of accurate GPS measured exposure to obesogenic environments, particularly for pedestrians. While route length may be fairly well described, especially for urban populations, those living close to school, and those travelling by foot, the additional expense of acquiring GPS data seems important when assessing exposure to route environments.},

abstract = {Physical inactivity among children is on the rise. Active transport to school (ATS), namely walking and cycling there, adds to children's activity level. Little is known about how exposures along actual routes influence children's transport behavior. This study examined how natural and built environments influence mode choice among Dutch children aged 6-11 years. 623 school trips were tracked with global positioning system. Natural and built environmental exposures were determined by means of a geographic information system and their associations with children's active/passive mode choice were analyzed using mixed models. The actual commuted distance is inversely associated with ATS when only personal, traffic safety, and weather features are considered. When the model is adjusted for urban environments, the results are reversed and distance is no longer significant, whereas well-connected streets and cycling lanes are positively associated with ATS. Neither green space nor weather is significant. As distance is not apparent as a constraining travel determinant when moving through urban landscapes, planning authorities should support children's ATS by providing well-designed cities.},

Compression garments have anecdotal and research supported evidence of enhancing exercise performance. However, the absence of sport specificity warrants further investigation. A cross-over repeated measures design was used to investigate the effectiveness of compression garments in improving physiological variables in a netball-specific circuit. Field-based measures included 20 m sprints, countermovement jumps and blood lactate concentrations. Circuit data also used data recorded from GPS (GPSpi 10) motion trackers, including heart rates, distance covered, and velocity. On separate occasions, three repeats of a netball-specific circuit occurred under three different garment conditions (usual netball attire, compression garment and placebo garment). Repeated measures ANOVA found no garment by dependent variable interactions during the repeated circuits under three garment conditions. Analysis of effect sizes however, showed greater distances traveled at a faster velocity (3.5 m s-1) using compression garments in comparison to control and placebo garments (Cohen's d = 0.86). Using traditional statistical analysis, performance enhancing effects of compression garments were minimal. However, results of effect sizes analyses showed repeated performances at high speeds were improved in this sample of well-trained netball players. ?? 2007 Sports Medicine Australia.},

abstract = {Objectives: Understanding of the physical demands and the effects of fatigue and substitute players in rugby sevens is limited. This study quantified the differences in movement patterns between domestic and international rugby sevens tournaments, the effects of fatigue within and between matches during tournaments, and movement patterns of second half substitute players. Design: Movement patterns of 19 international-level male rugby sevens players were recorded using a Global Positioning System (GPS) device during 11 international and 16 domestic matches (n= 174 files). Methods: Maximum velocity, total distance covered, distance covered in velocity zones and number of moderate and high accelerations and decelerations are reported per min of match time. Movement patterns were compared between international and domestic matches, first and second half, first and last tournament match and substitute and full-match players. Results: Substantially greater distance was covered at high velocity (???27{\%} at ???6ms 
                        -1) and 4-39{\%} more accelerations and decelerations were performed in international than domestic matches. The relative distance covered by players at velocities >2ms

abstract = {Background: The choice of geographical unit of analysis in studies of the built environment and physical activity has typically been restricted to the home neighbourhood where only a small proportion of physical activity may actually be undertaken. This study aimed to examine the distance from home at which physical activity takes place and how this varies by personal and neighbourhood characteristics. Methods: A cross-sectional, population based study of 195 people in the North West region of England, aged 18 to 91 years, clustered in 60 localities (small geographical areas of similar to 125 households). Individual socio-demographic data were collected by computer-aided personal interviews and physical activity was characterised by accelerometer and Global Positioning System (GPS) data. The locations of periods of light, moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity (LMVPA) undertaken outdoors were linked to measures of the neighbourhood around the home and distance from home. Results: Sixty per cent of outdoors LMVPA took place outside of the proximal home neighbourhood (800 m buffer). Distances from home where median levels of LMVPA were undertaken varied by gender (p {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.05), home location, area deprivation, and car ownership (all p {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.001). Conclusions: Objectively measured physical activity appears to vary appreciably by participant characteristics and home location, although for many settings a large proportion is undertaken outside of the home neighbourhood, suggesting the characterisation of neighbourhoods close to home will fail to properly capture the environmental influences on physical activity.},

Traditional residential buffers had lower destination density and diversity than activity spaces. Activity spaces based only on pedestrian and bicycling trips had higher destination densities than all-mode activity spaces. Regardless of neighborhood definition, adjusted associations between destinations and physical activity generally failed to reach statistical significance. However, within pedestrian and bicycling-based activity spaces, each additional destination type was associated with 243.3 more steps/day (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) [36.0, 450.7]). Traditional buffers may not accurately portray the geographic space or neighborhood resources experienced by older adults.

Global Positioning Systems (GPS) may represent an important opportunity to measure, describe, and compare mobility patterns in older adults. METHODS: We generated three types of activity spaces (Standard Deviation Ellipse, Minimum Convex Polygon, Daily Path Area) using GPS data from 95 older adults in Vancouver, Canada. Calculated activity space areas and compactness were compared across sociodemographic and resource characteristics. RESULTS: Area measures derived from the three different approaches to developing activity spaces were highly correlated. Participants who were younger, lived in less walkable neighborhoods, had a valid driver's license, had access to a vehicle, or had physical support to go outside of their homes had larger activity spaces. Mobility space compactness measures also differed by sociodemographic and resource characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: This research extends the literature by demonstrating that GPS tracking can be used as a valuable tool to better understand the geographic mobility patterns of older adults.

abstract = {We aimed to quantify the time-motion characteristics and technical demands of small-sided soccer games (SSGs) played on small, medium and large pitches using a high frequency non-differential global positioning system (NdGPS) that allowed assessment of acceleration and deceleration patterns. Eight male soccer players competed in SSGs comprising 4 x 4 min quarters (3 min recovery) on small (30 x 20 m) medium (40 x 30 m) and large (50 x 40 m) pitch sizes. Time motion analysis using a NdGPS positioning system quantified distance covered sprinting ({\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}= m s(-1)), high speed running ({\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}= 5.8 m s(-1)) and low (1-2 m s(-2)), medium (2-3 m s(-2)) and high ({\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}3 m s-2) acceleration. The frequency of common technical actions (passing, turning, dribbling, shooting, tackling, heading and interceptions) was performed using a hand notation system. SSGs played on medium and large pitches had a greater physical demand than on small pitches, with significantly more distance covered in all movement categories. Total distance covered in acceleration categories ranged from 230 +/- 111 (small pitch) to 356 +/- 72 m (medium pitch). The small pitch imposed a greater technical demand on players (more passes, shots and tackles) compared to medium and large pitches. The study provides novel data demonstrating the acceleration patterns observed in SSGs are relatively greater than those observed during professional match play. Thus SSGs might offer a "density" type conditioning stimulus. Practitioners should be aware that changes in pitch size impact both the physical and technical demands of SSGs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the neuromuscular and perceptual fatigue responses to consecutive tag football matches played on the same day and determine the relationship between fatigue and match running performance. METHODS: Neuromuscular and perceptual fatigue responses of 15 national tag football players were assessed before and during the 2014 State of Origin tournament. Global positioning systems (GPS) provided data on players' match running performance, and a vertical-jump test and subjective questionnaire were used to assess players' neuromuscular and perceptual fatigue, respectively. RESULTS: There were small to moderate reductions in the majority of match-running-performance variables over consecutive matches, including distance (ES=-0.81), high-speed-running (HSR) distance (ES=-0.51), HSR efforts (ES=-0.64), and maximal accelerations (ES=-0.76). Prematch vertical jump was initially below baseline values before the first match (ES=0.68-0.88). There were no substantial reductions in vertical-jump performance from baseline values over consecutive matches, although there was a small decline from after match 2 to after match 3 (3.3{\%}; ES=-0.45+/-0.62). There were progressive reductions in perceived well-being scores after matches 1 (ES=-0.38), 2 (ES=-0.70), and 3 (ES=-1.14). There were small to moderate associations between changes in fatigue measures and match running performance. CONCLUSIONS: Perceptual fatigue accumulates over consecutive tag football matches, although there were only marginal increases in neuromuscular fatigue. However, both neuromuscular and perceptual fatigue measures were found to contribute to reduced match running performance in the final match.},

Twenty-four adult residents of Boyle Heights, a neighborhood near downtown Los Angeles, carried a portable air pollution monitor and a Global Positioning Systems (GPS) tracking device for a total of 96 days. We found significant spatial and temporal variation in the particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pPAH) concentrations in transportation microenvironments. Average pPAH concentrations were higher while walking outdoors (190 ng m(-3)) compared to traveling in private passenger vehicles (138-155 ng m(-3)) or traveling in public transportation (61-124 ng m(-3)). Although travel comprised 5{\%} of participant days, it was associated with 27{\%} of overall daily pPAH exposure. Regression models explained 40-55{\%} of the variation in daily average pPAH concentrations, and 40-44{\%} of the variation in 1-min interval concentrations. Important factors included time spent traveling, travel speed, meteorological and nearby land use factors, time of day, and proximity to roadways. Although future research is needed to develop stronger predictive models, our study demonstrates portable tracking devices can provide a more complete, diurnal characterization of air pollution exposures for urban populations.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantify activity profiles in approximately 5-min periods to determine if the intensity of rugby league match play changes after the most intense period of play and to determine if the intensity of activity during predefined periods of match play differ between successful and less-successful teams playing at an elite standard. METHODS: Movement was recorded using a MinimaxX global positioning system (GPS) unit sampling at 10 Hz during 25 rugby league matches, equating to 200 GPS files. Data for each half of match play were separated into 8 equal periods. These periods represented the most intense phase of match play (peak period), the period after the most intense phase of match play (subsequent period), and the average demands of all other periods in a match (mean period). Two rugby league teams were split into a high-success and a low-success group based on their success rates throughout their season. RESULTS: Compared with their less-successful counterparts, adjustables and hit-up forwards from the high-success team covered less total distance (P < .01) and less high-intensity-running distance (P < .01) and were involved in a greater number of collisions (P < .01) during the mean period of match play. CONCLUSIONS: Although a greater number of collisions during match play is linked with a greater rate of success, greater amounts of high-intensity running and total distance are not related to competitive success in elite rugby league. These results suggest that technical and tactical differences, rather than activity profiles, may be the distinguishing factor between successful and less-successful rugby league teams.},

abstract = {This study investigated whether match intensi- ties during predefined periods differed among successful and less-successful rugby league teams. 4 semi-elite rugby league teams were split into ‘high-success’ and ‘low-success’ groups based on their success rates. Movement was recorded using a global positioning system (10 Hz) during 20 rugby league matches. Follow- ing the peak ball-in-play time period, the high- success group was able to maintain ball-in-play time that was: (1) 22 {\%} greater than the low-suc- cess group (P = 0.01) and (2) greater than their mean period of match-play (P = 0.01). In the peak and mean periods of match play, hit-up forwards from the high-success group covered less total distance (P = 0.02; P = 0.01), less high-intensity running distance (P = 0.01; P = 0.01) and were involved in a greater number of collisions (P = 0.03; P = 0.01) than hit-up forwards from the low-success group. These results demonstrate that greater amounts of high-intensity running and total distance are not related to competitive success in semi-elite rugby league. Rather, com- petitive success is associated with involvement of hit-up forwards in a greater number of collisions and the ability of high-success teams to maintain a higher ball-in-play time following the peak period. Strength and conditioning programs that: (1) emphasize high-intensity running and neglect to combine these running demands with colli- sions, and (2) do not offer exposure to match spe- cific ball-in-play time demands, may not provide sufficient physiological preparation for teams to be successful in rugby league. accepted},

abstract = {Precise measurement of physical activity is important for health research, providing a better understanding of activity location, type, duration, and intensity. This article describes a novel suite of tools to measure and analyze physical activity behaviors in spatial epidemiology research. We use individual-level, high-resolution, objective data collected in a space-time framework to investigate built and social environment influences on activity. First, we collect data with accelerometers, global positioning system units, and smartphone-based digital travel and photo diaries to overcome many limitations inherent in self-reported data. Behaviors are measured continuously over the full spectrum of environmental exposures in daily life, instead of focusing exclusively on the home neighborhood. Second, data streams are integrated using common timestamps into a single data structure, the "LifeLog." A graphic interface tool, "LifeLog View," enables simultaneous visualization of all LifeLog data streams. Finally, we use geographic information system SmartMap rasters to measure spatially continuous environmental variables to capture exposures at the same spatial and temporal scale as in the LifeLog. These technologies enable precise measurement of behaviors in their spatial and temporal settings but also generate very large datasets; we discuss current limitations and promising methods for processing and analyzing such large datasets. Finally, we provide applications of these methods in spatially oriented research, including a natural experiment to evaluate the effects of new transportation infrastructure on activity levels, and a study of neighborhood environmental effects on activity using twins as quasi-causal controls to overcome self-selection and reverse causation problems. In summary, the integrative characteristics of large datasets contained in LifeLogs and SmartMaps hold great promise for advancing spatial epidemiologic research to promote healthy behaviors.},

abstract = {Background: Identification of active or sedentary modes of transport is of relevance for studies assessing physical activity or addressing exposure assessment. We assessed in a proof-of-principle study if speed as logged by GPSs could be used to identify modes of transport (walking, bicycling, and motorized transport: car, bus or train). Methods: 12 persons commuting to work walking, bicycling or with motorized transport carried GPSs for two commutes and recorded their mode of transport. We evaluated seven speed metrics: mean, 95th percentile of speed, standard deviation of the mean, rate-of-change, standardized-rate-of-change, acceleration and deceleration. We assessed which speed metric would best identify the transport mode using discriminant analyses. We applied cross validation and calculated agreement (Cohen's Kappa) between actual and derived modes of transport. Results: Mode of transport was reliably classified whenever a person used a mode of transport for longer than one minute. Best results were observed when using the 95th percentile of speed, acceleration and deceleration (kappa 0.73). When we combined all motorized traffic into one category, kappa increased to 0.95. Conclusions: GPS-measured speed enable the identification of modes of transport. Given the current low costs of GPS devices and the built-in capacity of GPS tracking in most smartphones, the use of such devices in large epidemiological studies may facilitate the assessment of physical activity related to transport modes, or improve exposure assessment using automated travel mode detection.},

This article reports results from a Global Positioning System (GPS)-based pilot study that examined the mobility of middle-class, older adults living in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. Using mobility as a lens through which to examine the lives of older adults, we map potential research and identify policy areas of interest considering older adults in urban India. The study explores the role of life stage in mobility as well as the effects of gender and urban environment on mobility. Using this distinctive perspective on day-to-day life, we propose themes through which, using policy and planning tools, the living environments of older adults in Indian cities can be improved. These policy measures include focusing on walkability and pedestrian safety in residential areas and building on existing mixed land use to create high accessibility to goods and services in urban environments.},

abstract = {Physical activity (PA) is influenced by the built environment. However, little is known about the types of built environment where adults spend their time, and at what levels of PA they engage in those environments. Understanding the effect of the built environment on PA requires insight into PA behavior at different types of locations (e.g., home, work, shopping centers, and sports facilities). Therefore, this study describes where adults aged 45-65 years were active with moderate-to-vigorous intensity (MVPA), and examines associations of socio-demographic factors and neighborhood with MVPA at these locations. Participants' (N = 308) PA was measured for seven days using accelerometers and GPS-devices. Adults spent most minutes of MVPA at home and work. Highest MVPA-ratios of total time spent at a location were achieved in sports facilities and during transport. Neighborhood characteristics and socio-demographic factors such as work status, health status and household structure, had significant effects on MVPA at various locations and on total MVPA. Understanding PA behavior at various locations may provide insights that allow professionals in different domains (e.g., health, landscaping, urban planning) to develop strategies to stimulate PA.},

@article{jarjour_cyclist_2013,
abstract = {Background: A travel mode shift to active transportation such as bicycling would help reduce traffic volume and related air pollution emissions as well as promote increased physical activity level. Cyclists, however, are at risk for exposure to vehicle-related air pollutants due to their proximity to vehicle traffic and elevated respiratory rates. To promote safe bicycle commuting, the City of Berkeley, California, has designated a network of residential streets as "Bicycle Boulevards." We hypothesized that cyclist exposure to air pollution would be lower on these Bicycle Boulevards when compared to busier roads and this elevated exposure may result in reduced lung function. Methods: We recruited 15 healthy adults to cycle on two routes - a low-traffic Bicycle Boulevard route and a high-traffic route. Each participant cycled on the low-traffic route once and the high-traffic route once. We mounted pollutant monitors and a global positioning system (GPS) on the bicycles. The monitors were all synced to GPS time so pollutant measurements could be spatially plotted. We measured lung function using spirometry before and after each bike ride. Results: We found that fine and ultrafine particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and black carbon were all elevated on the high-traffic route compared to the low-traffic route. There were no corresponding changes in the lung function of healthy non-asthmatic study subjects. We also found that wind-speed affected pollution concentrations. Conclusions: These results suggest that by selecting low-traffic Bicycle Boulevards instead of heavily trafficked roads, cyclists can reduce their exposure to vehicle-related air pollution. The lung function results indicate that elevated pollutant exposure may not have acute negative effects on healthy cyclists, but further research is necessary to determine long-term effects on a more diverse population. This study and broader field of research have the potential to encourage policy-makers and city planners to expand infrastructure to promote safe and healthy bicycle commuting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Community mobility of individuals following lower limb amputation is highly variable and has a great impact on their quality of life. Currently, clinical assessments of ambulatory ability and motivation influence prosthetic prescription. However, these outcome measures do not effectively quantify community mobility (ie, mobility outside of the clinic) of individuals with an amputation. Advances in global positioning systems (GPSs) and other wearable step-monitoring devices allow for objective, quantifiable measurement of community mobility. This case report will examine the combined use of a GPS unit and a step activity monitor to quantify community mobility and social interaction of an individual with transfemoral amputation due to dysvascular disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCASE DESCRIPTION: A 76-year-old woman with a unilateral transfemoral amputation due to vascular disease carried a commercial GPS unit and step activity monitor to quantify her community mobility and social interaction every day over a period of 1 month. The step activity monitor was affixed to her prosthesis. The patient used a wheelchair as well as her prosthesis for everyday mobility.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOUTCOME: Information from the GPS unit and step activity monitor provided quantitative details on the patient's steps taken in and out of the home, wheelchair use, prosthesis use, driving trips, and time spent on social and community trips.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: This case report describes a potential clinical measurement procedure for quantifying community mobility and social interaction of an individual with lower limb amputation. Future efforts are needed to validate this measurement tool on large sample sizes and in individuals with different mobility levels. Additionally, automatization of data analysis and technological approaches to reduce compromised GPS signals may eventually lead to a practical, clinically useful tool.},

Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Fifteen junior rugby league players (n = 8 forwards, 7 backs; mean +/- SE, age 16.6 +/- 0.2 years; body mass 81.6 +/- 3.0 kg; and height 178.9 +/- 1.8 cm) competed in five 40 min games over 5 days (two games each on days 1 and 2, one game on day 4, and no games on days 3 and 5). Over the competition, players performed a countermovement jump to assess neuromuscular fatigue, provided a fingertip blood sample to measure blood creatine kinase, and completed a questionnaire to monitor perceived wellbeing; ratings of perceived effort were recorded following each game. Global positioning system and video analysis of each game were used to assess match performance. Results: Over the first 3 days, there were progressive and large increases in neuromuscular fatigue which peaked 12 h after game 4 (forwards ES = 4.45, p = 0.014; backs ES = 3.62, p = 0.029), and muscle damage which peaked 1 h post game 4 (forwards ES = 4.45, p = 0.004; backs ES = 3.94 p = 0.012), as well as reductions in perceived wellbeing. These measures gradually recovered over the final 2 days of the competition. Compared to the backs, the forwards experienced greater increases in creatine kinase following game 2 (ES = 1.30) and game 4 (ES = 1.24) and reductions in perceived wellbeing (ES = 0.25-0.46). Match intensity, high-speed running, and repeated-high intensity effort bouts decreased in games 4 and 5 of the competition. Small to large associations were observed between the changes in fatigue, muscle damage and match performance, with significant correlations between creatine kinase and repeated high-intensity effort bout number (r = -0.70, p = 0.031) and frequency (r = 0.74, p = 0.002) and low-speed activity (r = -0.56, p = 0.029). Conclusions: Fatigue and muscle damage accumulate over an intensified competition, which is likely to contribute to reductions in high-intensity activities and work rates during competition.

Players performed 1, 2, or 3 x 5 s wrestles in the single-, double- and triple-contact game, respectively. The movement demands (including distance covered and intensity of exercise) in each game were monitored using global positioning system units. Bench press and back squat 1 repetition maximum and 30-15 intermittent fitness test (30-15IFT) assessed muscular strength and high-intensity running ability, respectively. RESULTS: There was little change in distance covered during the single-contact game (ES = -0.16 to -0.61) whereas there were larger reductions in the double- (ES = -0.52 to -0.81) and triple-contact (ES = -0.50 to -1.15) games. Significant relationships (p<0.05) were observed between 30-15IFT and high-speed running during the single (r = 0.72) and double- (r = 0.75), but not triple-contact (r = 0.20) game. CONCLUSIONS: There is little change in running intensity when only single-contacts are performed each bout; however when multiple contacts are performed, greater reductions in running intensity result. In addition, high-intensity running ability is only associated with running performance when contact demands are low.},

J Strength Cond Res 27(3): 643-654, 2013-This study investigated the physiological responses to an intensified period of rugby league competition and the subsequent impact on match performance. The participants were 7 rugby league players competing in an international student tournament. The tournament involved three 80-minute games over a 5-day period, with 48 hours between each match. Baseline measures of upper and lower body neuromuscular functions via a plyometric press-up (PP) and countermovement jump (CMJ), respectively (peak power and peak force were measured), blood creatine kinase (CK), and perceptions of well-being were assessed with a questionnaire. These measures were repeated every morning of the competition; neuromuscular fatigue and CK were additionally assessed within 2 hours after the cessation of each game. During each match, player movements were recorded via global positioning system units. There were meaningful reductions in upper (effect size [ES] = -0.55) and lower body (ES = -0.73) neuromuscular functions, and perceptual well-being (ES = -1.56) and increases in blood CK (ES = 2.32) after game 1. These changes increased in magnitude as the competition progressed. There were large reductions in the relative distance covered in high-speed running (ES = -1.49) and maximal accelerations (ES = -0.85) during game 3. Additionally, moderate reductions in the percentage of successful tackles completed were observed during game 3 (ES = -0.59). Collectively, these results demonstrate that during an intensified period of rugby league competition, characterized by only 48 hours between matches, fatigue will accumulate. This cumulative fatigue may compromise high-intensity match activities such as high-speed running, accelerations, and tackling. Furthermore, CMJs and PPs appear to be sensitive measures for monitoring neuromuscular function in rugby league players.},

abstract = {A bicycle is a promising human-powered and emission-free transportation mode to address growing transportation and environmental problems. Bike-friendly environments should be constructed to innovatively increase the use of bicycles as a significant transportation mode. From this perspective, the scientific and effective monitoring of bicycling environments is of keen interest. An important technical challenge for monitoring is to evaluate the performance of bicycling environments. This study proposes a novel monitoring method that can be used for evaluating bicycle performance in terms of safety and mobility. An instrumented probe bicycle (IPB), which is equipped with a set of sensors including a global positioning systems (GPS) receiver, accelerometer, and gyro sensor, was used to develop the proposed monitoring method. The IPB provides useful bicycle maneuvering data for identifying longitudinal, lateral, and vertical maneuverings of the bicycle, which are affected by environmental factors such as heavy vehicle volume, surface conditions, grade, crossings, humps, and curbs. Regarding safety monitoring, an index to predict bicyclist's perceived safety and comfort with the predictors derived from the measurements by the IPB was developed. A questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain actual responses from bicyclists for perceived safety and comfort during the field experiment. In addition, a method to evaluate the bicycle mobility using GPS speed data was devised. Then, a fault tree analysis (FTA) technique, which is a well-known technique for risk analysis, was adopted to integrate safety and mobility monitoring. As a result, the bicycling monitoring index (BMI) was proposed. Data derived from the proposed method is expected to be effectively used for promoting the bicycle use by supporting the development and evaluation of various bicycle-related policies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

To increase the use of bicycles, it is fundamental to provide bicycle-friendly environments. The scientific assessment of a bicyclist's perception of roadway environment, safety and comfort is of great interest. This study developed a methodology for categorizing bicycling environments defined by the bicyclist's perceived level of safety and comfort. Second-by-second bicycle speed data were collected using global positioning systems (GPS) on public bicycles. A set of features representing the level of bicycling environments was extracted from the GPS-based bicycle speed and acceleration data. These data were used as inputs for the proposed categorization algorithm. A support vector machine (SVM), which is a well-known heuristic classifier, was adopted in this study. A promising rate of 81.6{\%} for correct classification demonstrated the technical feasibility of the proposed algorithm. In addition, a framework for bicycle traffic monitoring based on data and outcomes derived from this study was discussed, which is a novel feature for traffic surveillance and monitoring.},

abstract = {Background: The Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) is a longitudinal data collection process that systematically and continuously monitors population dynamics for a specified population in a geographically defined area that lacks an effective system for registering demographic information and vital events. Methods: HDSS programs have been run in 2 regions in Kenya: in Mbita district in Nyanza province and Kwale district in Coast Province. The 2 areas have different disease burdens and cultures. Vital events were obtained by using personal digital assistants and global positioning system devices. Additional health-related surveys have been conducted bimonthly using various PDA-assisted survey software. Results: The Mbita HDSS covers 55 929 individuals, and the Kwale HDSS covers 42 585 individuals. In the Mbita HDSS, the life expectancy was 61.0 years for females and 57.5 years for males. Under-5 mortality was 91.5 per 1000 live births, and infant mortality was 47.0 per 1000 live births. The total fertility rate was 3.7 per woman. Data from the Kwale HDSS were not available because it has been running for less than 1 year at the time of this report. Conclusions: Our HDSS programs are based on a computer-assisted survey system that provides a rapid and flexible data collection platform in areas that lack an effective basic resident registration system. Although the HDSS areas are not representative of the entire country, they provide a base for several epidemiologic and social study programs, and for practical community support programs that seek to improve the health of the people in these areas.},

However, loss of driving privileges can dramatically reduce independence and quality of life for older members of the community. The aim of this trial is to examine the effectiveness of a safe transport program for drivers aged 75 years and older at reducing driving exposure but maintaining mobility. Methods and design A randomised trial will be conducted, involving 380 drivers aged 75 years and older, resident in urban and semi-rural areas of North-West Sydney. The intervention is an education program based on the Knowledge Enhances Your Safety (KEYS) program, adapted for the Australian context. Driving experience will be measured objectively using an in-vehicle monitoring device which includes a global positioning system (GPS) to assess driving exposure and an accelerometer to detect rapid deceleration events. Participation will be assessed using the Keele Assessment of Participation (KAP). Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis; the primary outcomes include driving exposure, rapid deceleration events and scores for KAP. Secondary outcomes include self-reported measures of driving, socialisation, uptake of alternative forms of transport, depressive symptoms and mood. A detailed process evaluation will be conducted, including examination of the delivery of the program and uptake of alternative forms of transport. A subgroup analysis is planned for drivers with reduced function as characterized by established cut-off scores on the Drivesafe assessment tool. Discussion This randomised trial is powered to provide an objective assessment of the efficacy of an individually tailored education and alternative transportation program to promote safety of older drivers but maintain mobility.

The GPS data were categorised into relative total distance (mmin(-1)) and relative high-speed running distance (HSR mmin(-1), >14.4kmh(-1)). Each match was classified according to season phase, location, recovery length, opposition strength and result. Individual player fitness status was obtained from a 1.2-km shuttle run test conducted prior to the start of the season. Two separate linear mixed models were constructed to examine the influence of match-related and individual player characteristics on relative total and HSR distances.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Matches played away from home, early in the season and following short recovery cycles were associated with reduced relative total and HSR distances. Matches won contained less relative total and HSR distance; whereas only HSR distance was higher against weaker opposition. The total time the ball was out of play reduced relative total but not HSR distances. The number of defensive but not attacking involvements influenced both physical performance measures. Finally, player fitness was positively related to both relative total and HSR distances.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: There appears to be a complex interplay of factors affecting match-running performance in rugby league. The results underline the importance of considering contextual factors when analysing rugby league match-activity profiles.},

abstract = {Purpose: To describe the physical and technical demands of rugby league 9s (RL9s) match play for positional groups. Methods: Global positioning system data were collected during 4 games from 16 players from a team competing in the Auckland RL9s tournament. Players were classified into positional groups (pivots, outside backs, and forwards). Absolute and relative physical-performance data were classified as total high-speed running (HSR; > 14.4 km/h), very-high-speed running (VHSR; > 19.0 km/h), and sprint (> 23.0 km/h) distances. Technical-performance data were obtained from a commercial statistics provider. Activity cycles were coded by an experienced video analyst. Results: Forwards (1088 m, 264 m) most likely completed less overall and high-speed distances than pivots (1529 m, 371 m) and outside backs (1328 m, 312 m). The number of sprint efforts likely varied between positions, although differences in accelerations were unclear. There were no clear differences in relative total (115.6-121.3 m/min) and HSR (27.8-29.8 m/min) intensities, but forwards likely performed less VHSR (7.7 m/min) and sprint distance (1.3 m/min) per minute than other positions (10.2-11.8 m/min, 3.7-4.8 m/min). The average activity and recovery cycle lengths were similar to 50 and similar to 27 s, respectively. The average longest activity cycle was similar to 133 s, while the average minimum recovery time was similar to 5 s. Technical involvements including tackles missed, runs, tackles received, total collisions, errors, off-loads, line breaks, and involvements differed between positions. Conclusions: Positional differences exist for both physical and technical measures, and preparation for RL9s play should incorporate these differences.},

abstract = {Objectives: To assess between match variability of physical performance measures over both the total and sub sections of the match in professional rugby league competition. Design: Longitudinal observational study. Methods: Global positioning system (GPS) data were collected from 24 players from the same team competing in the National Rugby League (NRL) competition over 23 matches during 2011 season. The GPS data were categorised into total distance, high-speed running (>15kmh-1) and very high-speed running (>21kmh-1) distance for discrete reference periods (10min, 20min, 40min and 80min). The data was then log transformed to provide the coefficient of variation (CV) and the between subject standard deviation (both expressed as percentages). Results: The data show that the between match variability is greater for high-speed (CV 14.6{\%}) and very-high speed (CV 37.0{\%}) running compared to total distance (CV 3.6{\%}). Within each speed category, the variability of performance tended to increase as the duration of the reference period decreased. Conclusions: The results show that while global measures of physical performance such as total distance are relatively stable, higher-speed activities exhibit a large degree of between match variability. In addition, when segmenting the match into short periods of time for analysis, all physical performance measures increased in variability. These findings have implications for determining sample size, identifying reliable performance measures and selecting appropriate time periods for future applied studies that involve observational match analysis. ?? 2013 Sports Medicine Australia.},

Design: Longitudinal observational study. Methods: Global positioning system, accelerometer and technical performance measures (total kicks, handballs, possessions and Champion Data rank) were collected from 33 players competing in the Australian Football League over 31 matches during 2011-2012 (N=511 observations). The global positioning system data were categorised into total distance, mean speed (m min(-1)), high-speed running ({\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}14.4 km h(-1)), very high-speed running ({\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}19.9 km h(-1)), and sprint ({\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}23.0 km h(-1)) distance while player load was collected from the accelerometer. The data were log transformed to provide coefficient of variation and the between subject standard deviation (expressed as percentages). Results: Match-to-match variability was increased for higher speed activities (high-speed running, very high-speed running, sprint distance, coefficient of variation {\%}: 13.3-28.6{\%}) compared to global measures (speed, total distance, player load, coefficient of variation {\%}: 5.3-9.2{\%}). The between-match variability was relativity stable for all measures between and within AFL seasons, with only few differences between positions. Higher speed activities (high-speed running, very high-speed running, sprint distance), but excluding mean speed, total distance and player load, were all higher in the final third phase of the season compared to the start of the season. Conclusions: While global measures of physical performance are relatively stable, higher-speed activities and technical measures exhibit a large degree of between-match variability in Australian Football.

abstract = {Purpose: To describe the metabolic demands of rugby league match play for positional groups and compare match distances obtained from high-speed-running classifications with those derived from high metabolic power. Methods: Global positioning system (GPS) data were collected from 25 players from a team competing in the National Rugby League competition over 39 matches. Players were classified into positional groups (adjustables, outside backs, hit-up forwards, and wide-running forwards). The GPS devices provided instantaneous raw velocity data at 5 Hz, which were exported to a. customized spreadsheet. The spreadsheet provided calculations for speed-based distances (eg, total distance; high-speed running, {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}14.4 km/h; and very-highspeed running, {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}18.1 km/h) and metabolic-power variables (eg, energy expenditure; average metabolic power; and high-power distance, {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}20 W/kg). Results: The data show that speed-based distances and metabolic power varied between positional groups, although this was largely related to differences in time spent on field. The distance covered at high running speed was lower than that obtained from high-power thresholds for all positional groups; however, the difference between the 2 methods was greatest for hit-up forwards and adjustables. Conclusions: Positional differences existed for all metabolic parameters, although these are at least partially related to time spent on the field. Higher-speed running may underestimate the demands of match play when compared with high-power distance although the degree of difference between the measures varied by position. The analysis of metabolic power may complement traditional speed-based classifications and improve our understanding of the demands of rugby league match play.},

abstract = {Physical activity (PA) provides health benefits in older adults. Research suggests that exposure to nature and time spent outdoors may also have effects on health. Older adults are the least active segment of our population, and are likely to spend less time outdoors than other age groups. The relationship between time spent in PA, outdoor time, and various health outcomes was assessed for 117 older adults living in retirement communities. Participants wore an accelerometer and GPS device for 7 days. They also completed assessments of physical, cognitive, and emotional functioning. Analyses of variance were employed with a main and interaction effect tested for ±30 min PA and outdoor time. Significant differences were found for those who spent >30 min in PA or outdoors for depressive symptoms, fear of falling, and self-reported functioning. Time to complete a 400 m walk was significantly different by PA time only. QoL and cognitive functioning scores were not significantly different. The interactions were also not significant. This study is one of the first to demonstrate the feasibility of using accelerometer and GPS data concurrently to assess PA location in older adults. Future analyses will shed light on potential causal relationships and could inform guidelines for outdoor activity.},

abstract = {If an appliance perceives the location or health status of a resident in a smart home, it can actively provide more intelligent service. Thus, residents manually control the air conditioning in a passive service environment, whereas a location-based human-adaptive air conditioner autonomously regulates the temperature in a smart home according to residents' patterns of living or health status. This research is focused on developing a human-adaptive air conditioner that functions by measuring human factors with a non-terminal-based indoor positioning system, to provide high-quality intelligent service in single-person households. In this paper, four algorithms were introduced to provide high-quality intelligent service with a location-based human-adaptive air conditioner: (1) calculation of a resident's location and speed, (2) estimation of physical activity and metabolic rate, (3) calculation of the PMV index according to metabolic rate, and (4) an intelligent control algorithm. Finally, the feasibility of the design is evaluated experimentally on a test bed, using a pyroelectric infrared sensor-based location-aware system (PILAS) as the positioning system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal mortality in Kenya increased from 380/100000 live births to 530/100000 live births between 1990 and 2008. Skilled assistance during childbirth is central to reducing maternal mortality yet the proportion of deliveries taking place in health facilities where such assistance can reliably be provided has remained below 50{\%} since the early 1990s. We use the 2008/2009 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey data to describe the factors that determine where women deliver in Kenya and to explore reasons given for home delivery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Data on place of delivery, reasons for home delivery, and a range of potential explanatory factors were collected by interviewer-led questionnaire on 3977 women and augmented with distance from the nearest health facility estimated using health facility Global Positioning System (GPS) co-ordinates. Predictors of whether the woman's most recent delivery was in a health facility were explored in an exploratory risk factor analysis using multiple logistic regression. The main reasons given by the woman for home delivery were also examined.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Living in urban areas, being wealthy, more educated, using antenatal care services optimally and lower parity strongly predicted where women delivered, and so did region, ethnicity, and type of facilities used. Wealth and rural/urban residence were independently related. The effect of distance from a health facility was not significant after controlling for other variables. Women most commonly cited distance and/or lack of transport as reasons for not delivering in a health facility but over 60{\%} gave other reasons including 20.5{\%} who considered health facility delivery unnecessary, 18{\%} who cited abrupt delivery as the main reason and 11{\%} who cited high cost.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Physical access to health facilities through distance and/or lack of transport, and economic considerations are important barriers for women to delivering in a health facility in Kenya. Some women do not perceive a need to deliver in a health facility and may value health facility delivery less with subsequent deliveries. Access to appropriate transport for mothers in labour and improving the experiences and outcomes for mothers using health facilities at childbirth augmented by health education may increase uptake of health facility delivery in Kenya.},

The purpose of this study is to identify and assess domains (leisure, school, transport, home) and subdomains (e.g., recess, playgrounds, and urban green space) for week day moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) using objective measures and investigate gender and age differences. METHODS: Participants included 367 Danish children and adolescents (11-16 years, 52{\%} girls) with combined accelerometer and Global Positioning System (GPS) data (mean 2.5 days, 12.7 hrs/day). The Personal Activity and Location Measurement System and a purpose-built database assessed data in 15-second epochs to determine PA and assign epochs to 4 domains and 11 subdomains. Frequencies and proportions of time spent in MVPA were determined and differences assessed using multi-level modeling. RESULTS: More than 90{\%} of MVPA was objectively assigned to domains/subdomains. Boys accumulated more MVPA overall, in leisure, school and transport (all p{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}0.05). Children compared with adolescents accumulated more MVPA, primarily through more school MVPA (p{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}0.05). Boys spent a large proportion of time accumulating MVPA in playgrounds, active transport, Physical Education, sports facilities, urban green space and school grounds. Girls spent a significant proportion of time accumulating MVPA in active transport and playgrounds. No gender or age differences were found in the home domain. CONCLUSIONS: Large variations were found in PA frequency and intensity across domains/subdomains. Significant gender differences were found, with girls being less active in almost all domains and subdomains. Objectively measured patterns of PA across domains/subdomains can be used to better tailor PA interventions and inform future policies for promoting child PA.},

Objective context-specific assessment of physical activity patterns and correlates, such as outdoor time, may progress this field. AIMS: To employ novel objective measures to assess age and gender differences in context-specific outdoor weekday behavior patterns among school-children [outdoor time and outdoor moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)] and to investigate associations between context-specific outdoor time and MVPA. METHODS: A total of 170 children had at least one weekday of 9h combined accelerometer and global positioning system data and were included in the analyses. The data were processed using the personal activity and location measurement system (PALMS) and a purpose-built PostgreSQL database resulting in context-specific measures for outdoor time, outdoor MVPA, and overall daily MVPA. In addition, 4 domains (leisure, school, transport, and home) and 11 subdomains (e.g., urban green space and sports facilities) were created and assessed. Multilevel analyses provided results on age and gender differences and the association between outdoor time and MVPA.

Thirty patients were randomized for the study; 15 walker patients (70.7±6.4 yrs) and 15 Secure Track patients (68.2±6.7 yrs) (p=0.31). Total distance walked during all therapy sessions was nearly two times greater in the Secure Track (2,332 ft) than with the walker (1,241 ft)(p=.053). This trend began on the day of surgery (275 ft vs. 176 ft, p<.069) and was statistically significant by the following morning (287 ft vs. 151 ft, p=.019). Patients in the Secure Track spent a greater amount of time up and ambulating with the therapists in all sessions (.006<p>.30). At the first clinical follow-up, patients that had walked in the Secure Track completed the timed up and go test (TUG), a predictor of fall risk, 3 seconds faster than the standard rehabilitation group (9.6 vs. 12.9 seconds, p<.091). The novel therapy patients demonstrated significantly greater pain relief following the TUG test (p=.005). This study demonstrates that the choice of support device can increase patient ambulation following surgery, which will in turn improve functional outcomes and pain relief.},

abstract = {This study investigated the association between physical activity (PA) and the built environment, by focusing on gangi-dori, a traditional countermeasure structure against heavy snowfall in Joetsu, Japan. Gangi-dori refers to a row of conjoined housing eaves that form a roofed walking space along the street. For 55 participants aged 35-79 years in areas with and without gangi-dori, levels of PA and locations were simultaneously measured by accelerometer and using a global positioning system in non-snowfall and snowfall seasons. Findings indicate that the seasonal difference in PA was associated with the presence of gangi-dori: in the area with gangi-dori the amount of PA was greater in the snowfall season, while in the area without gangi-dori, there was less PA in the snowfall season. A remarkably large proportion of the time spent in gangi-dori was accounted for by non-sedentary activity in the snowfall season, with the median time spent there being 8.2. min/day. As the seasonal difference in time spent in gangi-dori was disproportionately small in relation to the difference in PA levels, the relationship between gangi-dori and physical activity may be indirect. These results suggest that gangi-dori may help to maintain or even increase levels of PA in the snowfall season, and demonstrate the potential of well-designed built environment features to support and promote PA in adverse climatic conditions. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

as a way to monitor the position and speed of an athlete during
outdoor activities with acceptable precision, thus controlling the
two most important factors of performance in endurance athletics,
i.e. inclination and speed. A detailed analysis of performance has
been shown to be possible in combination with metabolic gas
measurements. The combination of accelerometry and dGPS has also
been shown to improve physiological field testing. The technique
of dGPS could probably also be combined with other
bio-measurements (e.g. electromyography and cycling cadence and
power) and may enable other studies of exercise physiology in the
field, otherwise restricted to the laboratory environment. This
technique may also be of use in general exercise physiology where
monitoring of patients with, for example, cardiovascular and

abstract = {PURPOSE: The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based system for navigation. With this system, it is possible to pinpoint a subject's location on earth and to display the speed of movement. With the use of differentiation (dGPS), the accuracy of the GPS position and speed measurements can be improved. Our purpose was to investigate whether it would be possible to relate dGPS data with physiological variables in a field test and thus achieve a more controlled field test and hence improve the value of sport-specific testing. METHODS: 10 male orienteers were equipped with a portable metabolic gas analyzer and a differential Global Positioning System (dGPS). A field test was performed on a 4.3-km orienteering course. Oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide excretion, and heart rate were determined every 10 s. Speed was calculated by Doppler shift every 2 s and by differences in dGPS time and position. Validation of dGPS position, distance, and speed measurements was made on two fixed positions and on a 115-m straight asphalt road. RESULTS: The orienteers' route was visualized by the dGPS equipment. Detailed analysis of running speed in different sections of the course was made possible. Further, it was possible to relate each physiological data to the location of the subject. The correlation coefficient between speed measured by dGPS and speed measured by chronometry was r = 0.9995-0.9996. The mean errors of distance and position measurements were 0.04-0.7{\%} and 1.94-2.13 m, respectively. CONCLUSION: dGPS was shown to be a method that could give detailed information about a subject's speed and position. It was further demonstrated that physiological variables could be related to dGPS data.},

Correlation analyses showed a relationship between a high anaerobic threshold and few orienteering mistakes (r = - 0.64, P < 0.05). A high threshold of decompensated metabolic acidosis and VO2peak were related to a fast overall time (r = -0.70 to -0.72, P < 0.05) and high running speed (r = 0.64 to 0.79, P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), and were thus the best predictors of performance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The maximal walking distance (MWD) performed on a treadmill test remains the "gold standard" in estimating the walking capacity of patients who have peripheral arterial disease with intermittent claudication, although treadmills are not accessible to most physicians. We hypothesized that global positioning system (GPS) recordings could monitor community-based outdoor walking and provide valid information on walking capacity in patients with peripheral arterial disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 24 patients (6 women) with arterial claudication (median [25th to 75th percentile] values: 57 years old [48 to 67 years], 169 cm tall [164 to 172 cm], weight 81 kg [71 to 86 kg], and ankle-brachial index 0.64 [0.56 to 0.74]). MWD on the treadmill was 184 m (144 to 246 m), which was compared with the results of self-reported MWD, the distance score from the Walking Impairment Questionnaire, MWD observed during a 6-minute walking test, and MWD measured over a GPS-recorded unconstrained outdoor walk in a public park. Self-reported MWD, Walking Impairment Questionnaire distance score, 6-minute walking test score, and GPS-measured MWD were 300 m (163 to 500 m), 28{\%} (15{\%} to 47{\%}), 405 m (338 to 441 m), and 609 m (283 to 1287 m), respectively. The best correlation with MWD on the treadmill test was obtained with the MWD measured by the GPS (Spearman r=0.81, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Outdoor walking capacity measured by a low-cost GPS is a potentially innovative way to study the walking capacity of patients with peripheral arterial disease. It opens new perspectives in the study of walking capacity for vascular patients with claudication under free-living conditions or for physicians who do not have a treadmill.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether a low-cost, commercially available global positioning system (GPS) can be used to study outdoor walking of healthy subjects, allowing the detection of walking and resting (nonwalking) periods and the accurate estimation of speed and distance of each walking periods. METHODS: The same EGNOS-enabled GPS receiver was used for all experiments. In experiment 1, various signal-processing methodologies were tested for the detection of both walking and resting bouts from a prescribed walking protocol (PWP) that was performed 21 times by six healthy subjects on an outdoor athletic track. In experiment 2, the accuracies of these processing methodologies were then tested through a blinded analysis of different PWP for 10 other healthy subjects in a designated public park. In experiment 3, speed and distance calculated by the GPS receiver during series of 100-400 m on an outdoor athletic track were compared with actual speed and distance. RESULTS: Raw data were inaccurate, but the combination of a low-pass filter, an adapted high-pass filter, and artifact processing enabled one to detect walking and resting bouts with an accuracy of 89.8{\%} (95{\%} CI, 84.4-93.4). A manual post-processing methodology, used to complete previous automatic processing results, provided the highest concordance with the PWP, reaching an accuracy of 97.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 93.5-98.8). There was an excellent relationship both between actual and processed distances (R2=1.000) and between actual and processed speeds (R2=0.947). CONCLUSION: Low-cost, commercially available GPS may be accurate in studying outdoor walking, provided that simple data processing is applied.

abstract = {Objective: Global positioning system (GPS) recordings can provide valid information on walking capacity in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication (IC) during community-based outdoor walking. This study used GPS to determine the variability of the free-living walking distance between two stops (WDBS), induced by lower-limb pain, which may exist within a single stroll in PAD patients with IC and the potential associated parameters obtained from GPS analysis. Methods: This cross-sectional study of 57 PAD patients with IC was conducted in a university hospital. The intervention was a 1-hour free-living walking in a flat public park with GPS recording at 0.5 Hz. GPS-computed parameters for each patient were WDBS, previous stop duration (PSD), cumulated time from the beginning of the stroll, and average walking speed for each walking bout. The coefficient of variation of each parameter was calculated for patients with the number of walking bouts (NWB) ???5 during their stroll. A multivariate analysis was performed to correlate WDBS with the other parameters. Results: Mean (SD) maximal individual WDBS was 1905 (1189) vs 550 (621) meters for patients with NWB <5 vs NWB ??? 5, respectively (P < .001). In the 36 patients with NWB ??? 5, the coefficient of variation for individual WDBS was 43{\%}. Only PSD and cumulated time were statistically associated with WDBS in 16 and 5 patients, respectively. Conclusions: A wide short-term variability of WDBS exists and likely contributes to the difficulties experienced by patients with IC to estimate their maximal walking distance at leisurely pace. Incomplete recovery from a preceding walk, as estimated through PSD, seems to dominantly account for the WDBS in patients with IC. ?? 2010 Society for Vascular Surgery.},

abstract = {Abstract Purpose. To investigate the demographic, physical activity, and route characteristics related to children's school trips. Design. Cross-sectional exploratory study. Setting. Eighteen elementary schools in the Austin Independent School District, Austin, Texas. Subjects. One hundred twelve children aged 7 to 12 years. Measures. Accelerometer and Global Positioning System (GPS) devices provided objective measures of school travel and physical activity. Parental survey (response rate = 34.2{\%}) provided children's demographic and household information. Analysis. Generalized linear regression analyses were used for unadjusted and adjusted models estimating correlates of total moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and school trip-related MVPA's contribution rate. Results. Walking trips were .44 miles (.71 km) on average. Those who walked to school had about 11 more minutes of daily MVPA than nonwalkers (35.03 vs. 24.06) and higher proportions of their daily MVPA obtained from school commute trips (21.78{\%} vs. 2.41{\%}). School trips accounted for 11.2{\%} of total daily MVPA on average, 12.9{\%} for those who met the physical activity recommendation, and 35.2{\%} for the sedentary children who belonged to the lowest MVPA quartile. Conclusion. Active school commuting appears to be a valuable means to promote physical activity, and its contributions toward total physical activity vary across different demographic groups and community settings. Objective and detailed data from GPS and accelerometer units can facilitate the assessment of route/trip characteristics and physical activity implications of school transportation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is closely linked with child and youth health, and active travel may be a solution to enhancing PA levels. Activity spaces depict the geographic coverage of one's travel. Little is known about activity spaces and PA in adolescents.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relation between adolescent travel (using a spatial measure of activity space size) and daily moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), with a focus on school days.

METHODS: In Fall 2012, we used Global Positioning Systems to manually identify trips and generate activity spaces for each person-day; quantified by area for 39 students (13.8±0.6 years, 38{\%} female) attending high school in urban Downtown Vancouver, Canada. We assessed the association between activity space area and MVPA using multi-level regression. We calculated total, school-day and trip-based MVPA for each valid person-day (accelerometry; ≥ 600 min wear time).

RESULTS: On school days, students accrued 68.2 min/day (95{\%} CI 60.4-76.0) of MVPA. Daily activity spaces averaged 2.2 km(2) (95{\%} CI 1.3-3.0). There was no association between activity space size and school-day MVPA. Students accrued 21.8 min/day (95{\%} CI 19.2-24.4) of MVPA during school hours, 19.4 min/day (95{\%} CI 15.1-23.7) during travel, and 28.3 min/day (95{\%} CI 22.3-34.3) elsewhere.

CONCLUSION: School and school travel are important sources of PA in Vancouver adolescents, irrespective of activity space area covered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lifespace is a multidimensional construct that describes the geographic area in which a person lives and conducts their activities, and reflects mobility, health, and well-being. Traditionally, it has been measured by asking older people to self-report the length and frequency of trips taken and assistance required. Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors on smartphones have been used to measure Lifespace of older people, but not with people with Parkinson's disease (PD). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether GPS data collected via smartphones could be used to indicate the Lifespace of people with PD. METHODS: The dataset was supplied via the Michael J Fox Foundation Data Challenge and included 9 people with PD and 7 approximately matched controls. Participants carried smartphones with GPS sensors over two months. Data analysis compared the PD group and the control group. The impact of symptom severity on Lifespace was also investigated. RESULTS: Visualization methods for comparing Lifespace were developed including scatterplots and heatmaps. Lifespace metrics for comparison included average daily distance, percentage of time spent at home, and number of trips into the community. There were no significant differences between the PD and the control groups on Lifespace metrics. Visual representations of Lifespace were organized based on the self-reported severity of symptoms, suggesting a trend of decreasing Lifespace with increasing PD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Lifespace measured by GPS-enabled smartphones may be a useful concept to measure the progression of PD and the impact of various therapies and rehabilitation programs. Directions for future use of GPS-based Lifespace are provided.},

Participants spent a large portion of their out-of-school time (75{\%}) in their NAS. Although traveling far from home on occasion, 94.5{\%} of children’s time on average was spent within a short distance of home; participants spent little of their free time in broader neighborhood settings.

abstract = {Neighbourhoods are frequently used as a measure for individuals’ exposure to the food environment. However, the definitions of neighbourhoods fluctuate and have not been applied consistently in previous studies. Neighbourhoods defined from a single fixed location fail to capture people’s complete exposure in multiple locations, but measuring behaviour using traditional methods can be challenging. This study compares the traditional methods of measuring exposure to the food environment to methods that use data from GPS tracking. For each of the 187 participants, 11 different neighbourhoods were created in which the exposure to supermarkets and fast food outlets were measured. ANOVA, Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test and t-tests were performed to compare the neighbourhoods. Significant differences were found between area sizes and the exposure to supermarkets and fast food outlets for different neighbourhood types. Second, significant differences in exposure to food outlets were found between the urban and rural neighbourhoods. Neighbourhoods are clearly a diffused and blurred concept that varies in meaning depending on each person’s perception and the conducted study. Complexity and heterogeneity of human mobility no longer appear to correspond to the use of residential neighbourhoods but rather emphasise the need for methods, concepts and measures of individual activity and exposure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Estimating exposure levels and inhaled doses while traveling is an important part in the assessment of the health impacts of air pollution but it is also a challenging task. There is usually a trade-off between accurate concentrations estimates and sample size. Current research focuses mainly in air quality models for large population sets that do not account for individual variability (e.g. dispersion modelling for a city), or in individual exposure measurements that are applicable to specific groups of interest (e.g. exposure measurements of children or pregnant women). Although some authors have focused in exposure concentrations and travel time, recent studies also suggest that including respiration rates may substantially improve daily doses estimates. This study combines modelled air quality data with individual measurements of routes and physical activity using smartphones, achieving large population applicability while accounting for individual variability and respiration rates. 

METHODS
The data were measured in an active population of 172 individuals in Barcelona (Spain) using accelerometry and Global Positioning System (GPS) information from smartphones. A Land Use Regression (LUR) model and a dispersion model were used to estimate concentrations of particulate matter of less than 10 and 2.5 $\mu$m (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with a spatial resolution of 100 m. Temporal adjustments were performed using information from a background station. Ratios for different microenvironments (e.g. home, work) and transport modes (e.g. car, bicycle, bus) were applied on a minute-by-minute basis. Physical activity levels (measured in METS) were used to estimate breathing rates that in combination with estimated exposure were used to calculate inhaled doses. 

RESULTS
Although the subjects spend only 9{\%} of their time in transit, the contribution of this activity to the total inhaled dose is greater than 20{\%}. This increase is mainly due to significantly higher concentrations during transport than being at home (t-test, p>0.001) and increased physical activity (t-test, p>0.001). The uncertainty analysis shows that total inhaled dose while in transit can vary between 17{\%} and 45{\%}. These results are still part of ongoing analyses. 

CONCLUSIONS
Using smartphones in combination with air quality models shows that transport may have a substantial contribution to daily inhaled doses due to increased physical activity and concentration levels. However, bias in the sample with a large proportion of cyclists and a lack of reliable transport mode ratios need to be considered in the analysis.},

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the variation in training demands, physical performance, and player well-being across a women's soccer season. Methods: Seventeen elite female players wore GPS tracking devices during every training session (N = 90) throughout 1 national-league season. Intermittent high-speed-running capacity and 5-, 15-, and 25-m-sprint testing were conducted at the beginning of preseason, end of preseason, midseason, and end of season. In addition, subjective well-being measures were self-reported daily by players over the course of the season. Results: Time over 5 m was lowest at the end of preseason (mean 1.148 s, SE 0.017 s) but then progressively deteriorated to the end of the season (P < .001). Sprint performance over 15 m improved by 2.8{\%} (P = .013) after preseason training, while 25-m-sprint performance peaked at midseason, with a 3.1{\%} (P = .05) improvement from the start of preseason, before declining at the end of season (P = .023). Training demands varied between phases, with total distance and high-speed distance greatest during preseason before decreasing (P < .001) during the early- and late-season phases. Endurance capacity and well-being measures did not change across training phases. Conclusions: Monitoring training demands and subsequent physical performance in elite female soccer players allow coaches to ensure that training periodization goals are being met and related positive training adaptations are being elicited.

abstract = {Research increasingly suggests that moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is essential to children's health. However, little is known about the extent to which and when different urban environments influence the extent to which children engage in MVPA. To this end, this study explores the relationship between children's MVPA and urban land use and land cover (LULC) for several temporal subdivisions of children's weekly routines (before school, after school and weekends). In particular, the location and corresponding level of physical activity of 4th grade students (n=134) was recorded using paired global positioning system (GPS) receivers and accelerometers over 33days for each student. GPS locations were temporally related to accelerometry records and then geographically related to 13 categories of LULC. Mixed linear models were fitted to evaluate the extent to which duration spent in each LULC category can explain individuals' time in MVPA before school, after school, and during the weekends. Geographic cluster analysis was also applied to assess whether any significant spatial relationships between observations of MVPA may exist. Duration of exposure to vegetated parks/open spaces, built residential, and built institutional LULC was found to significantly increase children's time spent in MVPA. Further, most observations of MVPA were found to exhibit significant geographic clustering and were predominately associated with built residential areas (particularly those near schools), indicating the importance of neighborhoods and areas in close proximity to children's households on their level of physical activity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global positioning systems (GPS) are increasingly being used in health research to determine the location of study participants. Combining GPS data with data collected via travel/activity diaries allows researchers to assess where people travel in conjunction with data about trip purpose and accompaniment. However, linking GPS and diary data is problematic and to date the only method has been to match the two datasets manually, which is time consuming and unlikely to be practical for larger data sets. This paper assesses the feasibility of a new sequence alignment method of linking GPS and travel diary data in comparison with the manual matching method.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: GPS and travel diary data obtained from a study of children's independent mobility were linked using sequence alignment algorithms to test the proof of concept. Travel diaries were assessed for quality by counting the number of errors and inconsistencies in each participant's set of diaries. The success of the sequence alignment method was compared for higher versus lower quality travel diaries, and for accompanied versus unaccompanied trips. Time taken and percentage of trips matched were compared for the sequence alignment method and the manual method.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The sequence alignment method matched 61.9{\%} of all trips. Higher quality travel diaries were associated with higher match rates in both the sequence alignment and manual matching methods. The sequence alignment method performed almost as well as the manual method and was an order of magnitude faster. However, the sequence alignment method was less successful at fully matching trips and at matching unaccompanied trips.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Sequence alignment is a promising method of linking GPS and travel diary data in large population datasets, especially if limitations in the trip detection algorithm are addressed.},

Literature searches of the following bibliographic databases were undertaken: Sportdiscus, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Psychinfo and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA). Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, and covered topics including greenspace use, general land use, active travel, and the built environment. Studies were largely cross-sectional and took place across developed countries (UK, USA, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia). Findings suggest that roads and streets, school grounds, and the home location are important locations for total PA, and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA). The relationship between greenspace was positive, however, multiple definitions and outcome measures add complexity to the results. MVPA was more likely in those exposed to higher levels of greenspace compared to sedentary individuals. Total MVPA time in greenspace is low, but when framed as a proportion of the total can be quite high. Domestic gardens may be an important area for higher intensity activity. Researchers are encouraged to show transparency in their methods. As a relatively new area of research, with ever-evolving technology, future work is best placed in developing novel, but robust, methods to investigate the PA and environment relationship. Further descriptive work is encouraged to build on a small but increasing knowledge base; however, longitudinal studies incorporating seasonal/weather variation would also be extremely beneficial to elicit some of the nuances associated with land use. A greater understanding of geographic variation (i.e. within and between countries), as well as urban/suburban and rural dwelling is welcomed, and future work should also include the investigation of psycho-social health as an outcome, as well as differences in socio-economic status, sex and adiposity.},

abstract = {There are about 5 million people in Europe who have dementia, approximately half of whom need daily care. A common reason why dementia sufferers are admitted to long-term care is because of "wandering", i.e. leaving home without informing a carer, thereby potentially putting themselves at risk. Common methods of managing wandering include locking doors or alerting carers when a door is opened. A new method of managing wandering is by using electronic location devices. These depend on the satellite-based global positioning system (GPS). People can wear a location device in the form of a watch or pendant, or carry it like a mobile phone. This offers affected individuals the possibility of safe walking, with the reassurance that they can be found quickly if lost. However, it is not known how effective this method is and its use raises questions about safety and individual civil liberties. GPS location is a potentially useful method of managing wandering in dementia and there is considerable pressure on caregivers from commercial organisations to adopt the technique. Research is therefore required to determine which people are best suited for such devices, how effective they are in practice and what effect they have on important outcomes.},

abstract = {Active school travel is in decline. An understanding of the potential determinants of health-enhancing physical activity during the school commute may help to inform interventions aimed at reversing these trends. The purpose of this study was to identify the physical environmental factors associated with health-enhancing physical activity during the school commute. Data were collected in 2009 on 166 children commuting home from school in Scotland. Data on location and physical activity were measured using global positioning systems (GPS) and accelerometers, and mapped using geographical information systems (GIS). Multi-level logistic regression models accounting for repeated observations within participants were used to test for associations between each land-use category (road/track/path, other man-made, greenspace, other natural) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Thirty-nine children provided 2,782 matched data points. Over one third (37.1{\%}) of children's school commute time was spent in MVPA. Children commuted approximately equal amounts of time via natural and man-made land-uses (50.2{\%} and 49.8{\%} respectively). Commuting via road/track/path was associated with increased likelihood of MVPA (Exp(B)=1.23, P <0.05), but this association was not seen for commuting via other manmade land-uses. No association was noted between greenspace use and MVPA, but travelling via other natural land-uses was associated with lower odds of MVPA (Exp(B)=0.32, P <0.05). Children spend equal amounts of time commuting to school via man-made and natural land-uses, yet man-made transportation route infrastructure appears to provide greater opportunities for achieving health-enhancing physical activity levels.},

Although there is cross-sectional evidence that transit users have higher PA levels, this may be coincidental or shifted from activities such as recreational walking. We use a quasi-experimental design to test if light rail transit (LRT) generated new PA in a neighborhood of Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. Participants (. n=536) wore Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and accelerometers before (2012) and after (2013) LRT construction. We test within-person differences in individuals' PA time based on changes in transit usage pre- versus post-intervention. We map transit-related PA to detect spatial clustering of PA around the new transit stops. We analyze within-person differences in PA time based on daily transit use and estimate the effect of daily transit use on PA time controlling for socio-demographic variables. Results suggest that transit use directly generates new PA that is not shifted from other PA. This supports the public health benefits from new high quality public transit such as LRT.},

abstract = {Objective: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods have provided a rich assessment of the contextual factors associated with a wide range of behaviors including alcohol use, eating, physical activity, and smoking. Despite this rich database, this information has not been linked to specific locations in space. Such location information, which can now be easily acquired from global positioning system (GPS) tracking devices, could provide unique information regarding the space-time distribution of behaviors and new insights into their determinants. In a proof of concept study, we assessed the acceptability and feasibility of acquiring and combining EMA and GPS data from adult smokers with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: Participants were adults with ADHD who were enrolled in a larger EMA study on smoking and psychiatric symptoms. Among those enrolled in the latter study who were approached to participate (N = 11), 10 consented, provided daily EMA entries, and carried a GPS device with them during a 7-day assessment period to assess aspects of their smoking behavior. Results: The majority of those eligible to participate were willing to carry a GPS device and signed the consent (10 out of 11, 91{\%}). Of the 10 who consented, 7 participants provided EMA entries and carried the GPS device with them daily for at least 70{\%} of the sampling period. Data are presented on the spatial distribution of smoking episodes and ADHD symptoms on a subset of the sample to demonstrate applications of GPS data. Conclusions: We conclude by discussing how EMA and GPS might be used to study the ecology of smoking and make recommendations for future research and analysis.},

Six week prospective study design. Twenty-one data sets were recorded from nine individual players that completed the yo-yo IR2, and played an Australian Football League match in the first five rounds of the 2010 season wearing a global positioning system (GPS) unit. Simple mediation modelling was used to analyse the inter-relationship between yo-yo IR2 score, match exercise intensity and AF performance. Playing position and experience were also incorporated into the model to identify conditional affects. A significant direct relationship was observed between yo-yo IR2 and number of ball disposals (p {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.1) and a significant indirect relationship was observed between yo-yo IR2 and number of ball disposals through distance travelled at high intensity (HIR m min(-1)) (p {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.1). Moderation analysis showed that playing position affected the relationship between of yo-yo IR2 and HIR m min-1 (p {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.1) and HIR m min(-1) and total ball disposals (p {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.1). Playing experience also significantly affected the relationship between HIR m min(-1) and total ball disposals.

The objective of the current study was to assess the magnitude and variance of personal exposure to particulate matter 2.5 microns or smaller (PM2.5) and concomitant physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) for transportation by car, subway, or walking. Methods: Twenty nonsmoking volunteers from New York City traveled on predetermined routes by car, subway, and walking, for up to 8 hours on 3 different days, between October 2007 and February 2008. Outfitted with a personal monitor with PM2.5 aerosol inlet, and a GPS receiver, they completed a detailed physical activity diary for each route. Both metabolic equivalent (MET) and PAEE rates (Kcal/min) were computed from GPS-derived activity durations and speeds, activity-specific METs, and measured body weight. Results: Total PM2.5 exposures did not differ among car, subway, and walking arms (respectively, 21.4, 30.6, and 26.5 ??g/m3??min, p=0.19); but average MET values (respectively, 1.51, 2.03, and 2.60 Kcal/kg??hr, p<0.0001) and PAEE rates (1.74, 2.35, and 3.04 Kcal/min, p<0.0001) did. After correction for the humidity factor, exposure to PM2.5 appeared to be lower for the car arm (13.1 ??g/m3??min) than for the subway (19.6 ??g/m3??min) or walking (23.9 ??g/m3??min, p=0.004) arms. Conclusions: Driving cars was associated with less physical activity but not necessarily less exposure to PM2.5 than riding subways or walking in an urban environment. These effect sizes and variances can be used to design larger experiments assessing the health effects of urban transportation. ?? 2009 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) experience several physical and cognitive problems which can influence their travel behaviour. This study aimed to document the number of activities, the activity type and the transport mode of the related trips that are daily made by PwMS. Their outdoor activity and travel behaviour was studied in relation to disease-related disability. METHODS: Thirty six PwMS (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS, 1.5-8.0, age 27-63) and 24 healthy controls (age 25-62) were studied, using activity-related travel diaries and GPS tracking devices. Information about overall disability characteristics was gained by standard clinical tests and questionnaires. PwMS were further divided in three subgroups based on EDSS cut-off scores 4.5 and 6.5. RESULTS: Persons with mild ambulatory dysfunction (EDSS 1.5-4.0, n = 17) showed similar travel characteristics to healthy controls, with few restrictions during travelling. Statistically significant changes in activity and travel behaviour were detected in the moderate (EDSS 4.5-6.5, n = 8) and severe MS subgroups (EDSS > 6.5-8.0, n = 11) compared with healthy controls: driving independently became less frequent, significant more trips were made with company and the duration of performed activities had increased. CONCLUSION: The combination of self-reported travel diaries and objective GPS loggers offered detailed information about the actual outdoor travel behaviour of PwMS, which was significantly changed in PwMS with EDSS greater than 4. Implications for Rehabilitation Activity and travel behaviour changes significantly in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) with moderate to severe disability (EDSS greater than 4). Behavioural therapy could help to develop better coping and problem-solving skills to overcome anxiety in the making of trips by persons with MS with a mild severity. Enhancing community environments could serve as a promising approach to increase the outdoor participation of persons with (more severe) impairments.},

J Strength Cond Res 27(6): 1471-1478, 2013There is a need to ascertain if an association exists between excessive progression in weekly volume and development of running-related injuries (RRI). The purpose of this study was to investigate if GPS can be used to detect deleterious progression in weekly training volume among 60 novice runners included in a 10-week prospective study. All participants used GPS to quantify training volume while running. In case of injury, participants attended a clinical examination. The 13 runners who sustained injuries during follow-up had a significantly higher weekly progression in total training volume in the week before the injury origin (86{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval: 12.9-159.9], p = 0.026) compared with other weeks. Although not significant, participants with injuries had an increase in weekly training volume of 31.6{\%} compared with a 22.1{\%} increase among the healthy participants. The error of the GPS measurements in open landscape, forest, and urban area of volume was 6.2{\%}. To conclude, no clinically relevant measurement errors of the GPS devices were found for training volume. Based on this, GPS has a potential to detect errors in training volume, which may be associated with development of RRI. Based on the results from the current study, increases in weekly training progression may become deleterious at a weekly increase above 30{\%}, which is more than the 10{\%} rule currently used as a guideline for correct progression in weekly volume by runners and coaches. Still, no clear evidence for safe progression of weekly volume exists. But it seems likely that some individuals may tolerate weekly progressions around 20-25{\%}, at least for a short period of time.},

The outcome of interest was a running-related injury, defined as any musculoskeletal complaint of the lower extremity or back caused by running that restricted the amount of running (volume, duration, pace, or frequency) for at least 1 week. All participants quantified their running volume by global positioning system (GPS) and used a neutral running shoe. Time to first injury for each exposure variable was analyzed using a generalized linear model, with cumulative kilometers of the training sessions as the time scale. RESULTS: A total of 930 individuals were included in the study, of which 254 sustained a running-related injury during a total of 155.318km of running. By calculating the cumulative injury risk differences (cIRDs) [95{\%} confidence intervals] after 500km of running, the TASRI Type B behavior (cIRD, 11.9{\%} [-0.5{\%}; 23.3{\%}]; P = .04) was found to be a significant predictor of injury, while age between 45 and 65 years (cIRD, 14.7{\%} [-2.1{\%}; 31.5{\%}]; P = .08) and previous injuries not related to running (cIRD, 11.1{\%} [-0.2{\%}; 22.4{\%}]; P = .05) were considered clinically interesting, although not statistically significant. In addition, chi(2) test results across 4 BMI groups also revealed a borderline significant relationship (P = .06). No significant or clinically relevant relationships were found for sex (P = .42), previous running-related injury (P = .47), running experience (P = .30), and other sports activities (P = .30). CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study suggest BMI {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}30 kg/m(2), age between 45 and 65 years, noncompetitive behavior, and previous injuries not related to running are associated with increased risk of injury among novice runners, while BMI {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}20 kg/m(2) was protective. Still, the role of the risk factors in the causal mechanism leading to injury needs to be investigated.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: An explorative, 1-year prospective cohort study. Objective To examine whether an association between a sudden change in weekly running distance and running-related injury varies according to injury type. BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that a sudden increase in running distance is strongly related to injury in runners. But the scientific knowledge supporting this assumption is limited. METHODS: A volunteer sample of 874 healthy novice runners who started a self-structured running regimen were provided a global-positioning-system watch. After each running session during the study period, participants were categorized into 1 of the following exposure groups, based on the progression of their weekly running distance: less than 10{\%} or regression, 10{\%} to 30{\%}, or more than 30{\%}. The primary outcome was running-related injury. RESULTS: A total of 202 runners sustained a running-related injury. Using Cox regression analysis, no statistically significant differences in injury rates were found across the 3 exposure groups. An increased rate of distance-related injuries (patellofemoral pain, iliotibial band syndrome, medial tibial stress syndrome, gluteus medius injury, greater trochanteric bursitis, injury to the tensor fascia latae, and patellar tendinopathy) existed in those who progressed their weekly running distance by more than 30{\%} compared with those who progressed less than 10{\%} (hazard ratio = 1.59; 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.96, 2.66; P = .07). CONCLUSION: Novice runners who progressed their running distance by more than 30{\%} over a 2-week period seem to be more vulnerable to distance-related injuries than runners who increase their running distance by less than 10{\%}. Owing to the exploratory nature of the present study, randomized controlled trials are needed to verify these results, and more experimental studies are needed to validate the assumptions. Still, novice runners may be well advised to progress their weekly distances by less than 30{\%} per week over a 2-week period.},

For 2 typical week days during 2012?2013, the children were given a smartphone with CalFit software to obtain information on their location and physical activity level and a small sensor, the micro-aethalometer model AE51, to measure their black carbon levels simultaneously and continuously. We estimated their home and school exposure to PM2.5 filter absorbance, which is well-correlated with black carbon, using a temporally adjusted PM2.5 absorbance land use regression (LUR) model. We found considerable variation in the black carbon levels during the day, with the highest levels measured during commuting periods (geometric mean = 2.8 ?g/m3) and the lowest levels at home (geometric mean = 1.3 ?g/m3). Hourly temporally adjusted LUR model estimates for the home and school showed moderate to good correlation with measured personal black carbon levels at home and school (r = 0.59 and 0.68, respectively) and lower correlation with commuting trips (r = 0.32 and 0.21, respectively). The correlation between modeled home estimates and overall personal black carbon levels was 0.62. Personal black carbon levels vary substantially during the day. The correlation between modeled and measured black carbon levels was generally good, with the exception of commuting times.

Ten male employees (37 ± 9 yr) who usually commute by bicycle participated in this study. Global Positioning System (GPS) was used to analyze their commuting route three-dimensionally. And heart rate was recorded simultaneously to determine their exercise intensity. Blood test, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and maximal aerobic test was conducted in our laboratory. Semantic differential method (SD) questionnaire was conducted to clarify their feelings during and after their commute. The results of blood test and OGTT showed that all of determined values were good and no one exceeded the standard value. GPS log showed that subjects covered 13.3 ± 7.2 km and 40 ± 20 minute with integrating 201 ± 114 meter altitude gain per commute. Heart rate data showed 129 ± 12 bpm per commute. However, subjects demonstrated higher peak heart rate during their commute ranged between 157 and 181 bpm, we determined details by frequency distribution method. The data revealed that commuter cycling was consisted by aerobic exercise with intermittent vigorous intensity exercise. Despite of such a hard exercise cycling to work, the result of SD questionnaire indicated that subjects felt briskness with less tiredness when they commute. Commuter cycling with a higher than moderate exercise intensity, could have good physical and mental effects for employees.},

abstract = {Objective We used outdoor walking distance measured during 40 minutes as "real-life" outdoor walking capacity in 49 patients with intermittent claudication (IC). The outdoor walking distance was measured by a global positioning system application for a smartphone. The relationships of self-reported maximum walking distance (SR-MWD), the MWD on a graded treadmill test, and the 6-minute maximum walk distance (6MWD) vs outdoors walking capacity were investigated. Also studied were the associations of SR-MWD, MWD, and 6MWD with health-related quality of life assessed with the disease-specific instrument the Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire (VascuQoL). Methods In this prospective observational cohort study, 49 IC patients underwent an outdoor walking capacity test for 40 minutes, and MWD and 6MWD were measured. SR-MWD was recorded, and all subjects completed the VascuQoL questionnaire. Associations between the different walk estimates and outdoor walking capacity and health-related quality of life were investigated by correlation analysis (Spearman ??). Results Outdoor walking distance during 40 minutes was a median 2495 m (range, 1110-3300 m). SR-MWD correlated moderately and MWD correlated strongly to outdoor walking capacity (r = 0.56 and r = 0.65; P <.001, respectively). The 6MWD test showed the largest correlation to the outdoor walking capacity (r = 0.78; P <.001). The 6MWD was the only test that showed correlations with the VascuQoL sum score (r = 0.53; P <.01) and all of the domain scores, whereas SR-MWD and MWD showed weak correlations to the VascuQoL. Conclusions The distance walked during the 6-minute walk test is closely correlated to outdoor walking capacity and health-related quality of life in IC patients. Our data support the use of 6MWD for routine clinical evaluation of walking capacity in IC patients. Copyright ?? 2014 by the Society for Vascular Surgery.},

abstract = {Background: Low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with high risk of non-communicable diseases and all-cause mortality. Physical activity level is the primary determinant of cardiorespiratory fitness in adults. However, knowledge on how to motivate people to engage in physical activity and maintain an active lifestyle is lacking. This study aims to investigate whether a motivational, individual, and locally anchored exercise intervention, in primary care, can improve cardiorespiratory fitness in 30 to 49 year olds with a low or very low cardiorespiratory fitness. Methods/Design: Two-armed randomised controlled trial with 6 and 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome is cardiorespiratory fitness estimated via a maximal incremental exercise test. Secondary outcomes include physical activity level and sedentary behavior (objectively measured), self-reported physical activity, biochemical parameters (HbA1C, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride), anthropometric parameters and health-related quality of life. A total of 236 participants with low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness classified at a local health check programme will be randomised. The intervention consists of four motivational interviews, a six months membership to a sport club, and a global positioning watch to upload training activity to Endomondo.com. The comparison group will receive standard care: a one hour motivational interview followed by another interview if requested. Effects will be estimated by evaluating the differences in mean changes in cardiorespiratory fitness between the two groups. Discussion: In new and innovative ways the focus of this study will be to improve cardiorespiratory fitness among a 30-49 year-old at-risk group using social media, Global Positioning System-technology, on-going personal support and individually tailored physical activity.},

abstract = {Background: Modifying transport infrastructure to support active travel (walking and cycling) could help to increase population levels of physical activity. However, there is limited evidence for the effects of interventions in this field, and to the best of our knowledge no study has convincingly demonstrated an increase in physical activity directly attributable to this type of intervention. We have therefore taken the opportunity presented by a 'natural experiment' in Cambridgeshire, UK to establish a quasi-experimental study of the effects of a major transport infrastructural intervention on travel behaviour, physical activity and related wider health impacts. Design and methods: The Commuting and Health in Cambridge study comprises three main elements: a cohort study of adults who travel to work in Cambridge, using repeated postal questionnaires and basic objective measurement of physical activity using accelerometers; in-depth quantitative studies of physical activity energy expenditure, travel and movement patterns and estimated carbon emissions using household travel diaries, combined heart rate and movement sensors and global positioning system (GPS) receivers; and a longitudinal qualitative interview study to elucidate participants' attitudes, experiences and practices and to understand how environmental and social factors interact to influence travel behaviour, for whom and in what circumstances. The impacts of a specific intervention - the opening of the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway - and of other changes in the physical environment will be examined using a controlled quasi-experimental design within the overall cohort dataset. Discussion: Addressing the unresolved research and policy questions in this area is not straightforward. The challenges include those of effectively combining different disciplinary perspectives on the research problems, developing common methodological ground in measurement and evaluation, implementing robust quantitative measurement of travel and physical activity behaviour in an unpredictable 'natural experiment' setting, defining exposure to the intervention, defining controls, and conceptualising an appropriate longitudinal analytical strategy.},

The PHS has several advantages: high-speed data transmission, and little electromagnetic interference with medical devices, etc. In our system, patients have the PHS and a mobile computer for data transmission control between an implanted controller and a host computer in the hospital, and also a GPS receiver for location of patients. Information on motor rotational angle and motor current of the implanted motor-driven heart is fed into the mobile computer from the implanted controller according to 32-bit command codes from the host computer. Motor current and motor rotational angle data from inside the body are framed together by a control code (frame number and parity) for data error checking and correcting at the receiving site, and the data are sent through the PHS connected to the mobile computer. GPS positioning data and battery data from the mobile computer are also sent to the host computer with control codes. The host computer calculates pump outflow and arterial pressure from the motor rotational angle and motor current values and displays the data in real-time waveforms. The host computer also displays patient's position on the map and batteries' condition. The results of this study showed that accurate data could be transmitted from the subjects while they were walking or driving a car to the host computer at a data transmission rate of 32 kbps, and that driving condition of the artificial heart and subject's position could be remotely monitored on the host computer. This system is useful for remote monitoring of patients with an implanted artificial heart.},

abstract = {Utilization of movement data from mobile sports tracking applications is affected by its inherent biases and sensitivity, which need to be understood when developing value-added services for, e.g., application users and city planners. We have developed a method for generating a privacy-preserving heat map with user diversity (ppDIV), in which the density of trajectories, as well as the diversity of users, is taken into account, thus preventing the bias effects caused by participation inequality. The method is applied to public cycling workouts and compared with privacy-preserving kernel density estimation (ppKDE) focusing only on the density of the recorded trajectories and privacy-preserving user count calculation (ppUCC), which is similar to the quadrat-count of individual application users. An awareness of privacy was introduced to all methods as a data pre-processing step following the principle of k-Anonymity. Calibration results for our heat maps using bicycle counting data gathered by the city of Helsinki are good (R2>0.7) and raise high expectations for utilizing heat maps in a city planning context. This is further supported by the diurnal distribution of the workouts indicating that, in addition to sports-oriented cyclists, many utilitarian cyclists are tracking their commutes. However, sports tracking data can only enrich official in-situ counts with its high spatio-temporal resolution and coverage, not replace them.},

abstract = {Active travel is associated with improved health and development outcomes in children. Accurate detection of children’s travel behaviors and routes, however, is problematic. Travel diaries are often used to collect information on children’s travel behaviors, yet no evidence for the accuracy of this methodology exists. This study investigated the validity of children’s self-reported trips (origin, destination) compared with an objective criterion (global positioning systems units; GPS). Children (n = 10, 9–11 y) wore the GPS units for seven consecutive days between March and June 2011 and completed travel diaries daily with researcher assistance. Affinity group interviews were conducted in December 2011 with 30 children from two schools to garner perspectives on trip definition, neighborhood perceptions, and to illuminate GPS and travel diary findings. GPS journeys were manually compared with travel diary journeys for destination sequencing, start times, and travel mode. Accuracy in trip sequencing was compared by day type, and journey type using percentage differences and the chi-square ($\chi$2) statistic. Of the 380 trips captured, 54.5{\%} of journey sequences were fully or partially matched, 22.4{\%} were GPS only trips and 23.2{\%} travel diary only. Greater accuracy (full/partial match) was observed for weekdays than for weekend days and for the journey to or from school than for other journeys. Travel mode agreement existed for 99{\%} of matched trips. Although children’s travel diaries may confer contextual journey information, they may not provide completely accurate information on journey sequencing. Thematic analysis of affinity group data revealed that reasons for this are multifaceted, including differing concepts of what constitutes a ‘trip’. A combined approach of GPS and travel diary is recommended to gather a comprehensive understanding of children’s journey characteristics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global positioning systems (GPS), geographic information systems (GIS), and accelerometers are powerful tools to explain activity within a built environment, yet little integration of these tools has taken place. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of combining GPS, GIS, and accelerometry to understand transport-related physical activity (TPA) in adults. METHODS: Forty adults wore an accelerometer and portable GPS unit over 7 consecutive days and completed a demographics questionnaire and 7-day travel log. Accelerometer and GPS data were extracted for commutes to/from workplace and integrated into a GIS database. GIS maps were generated to visually explore physical activity intensity, GPS speeds and routes traveled. RESULTS: GPS, accelerometer, and survey data were collected for 37 participants. Loss of GPS data was substantial due to a range of methodological issues, such as low battery life, signal drop out, and participant noncompliance. Nonetheless, greater travel distances and significantly higher speeds were observed for motorized trips when compared with TPA. CONCLUSIONS: Pragmatic issues of using GPS monitoring to understand TPA behaviors and methodological recommendations for future research were identified. Although methodologically challenging, the combination of GPS monitoring, accelerometry and GIS technologies holds promise for understanding TPA within the built environment.},

Children's independent mobility (i.e., outdoor play and traveling to destinations unsupervised), an integral component of physical activity in childhood, has also declined radically in recent decades. Safety-conscious parenting practices, car reliance and auto-centric urban design have converged to produce children living increasingly sedentary lives. This research investigates how urban neighborhood environments can support or enable or restrict children's independent mobility, thereby influencing physical activity accumulation and participation in daily life.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS/DESIGN: The study is located in six Auckland, New Zealand neighborhoods, diverse in terms of urban design attributes, particularly residential density. Participants comprise 160 children aged 9-11 years and their parents/caregivers. Objective measures (global positioning systems, accelerometers, geographical information systems, observational audits) assessed children's independent mobility and physical activity, neighborhood infrastructure, and streetscape attributes. Parent and child neighborhood perceptions and experiences were assessed using qualitative research methods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: This study is one of the first internationally to examine the association of specific urban design attributes with child independent mobility.

abstract = {National trends indicate that children and adolescents are not achieving sufficient levels of physical activity. Combining global positioning system (GPS) technology with accelerometers has the potential to provide an objective determination in locations where youth engage in physical activity. The aim of this study was to identify the optimal methods for collecting combined accelerometer and GPS data in youth, to best locate where children spend time and are physically active. A convenience sample of 24 mid-school children in Massachusetts was included. Accelerometers and GPS units were used to quantify and locate childhood physical activity over 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. Accelerometer and GPS data were joined by time and mapped with a geographical information system (GIS) using ArcGIS software. Data were collected in winter, spring, summer in 2009-2010, collecting a total of 26,406 matched datapoints overall. Matched data yield was low (19.1{\%} total), regardless of season (winter, 12.8{\%}; spring, 30.1{\%}; summer, 14.3{\%}). Teacher-provided, pre-charged equipment yielded the most matched (30.1{\%}; range: 10.1-52.3{\%}) and greatest average days (6.1 days) of data. Across all seasons, children spent most of their time at home. Outdoor use patterns appeared to vary by season, with street use increasing in spring, and park and playground use increasing in summer. Children spent equal amounts of physical activity time at home and walking in the streets. Overall, the various methods for combining GPS and accelerometer data provided similarly low amounts of combined data. No combined GPS and accelerometer data collection method proved superior in every data return category, but use of GIS to map joined accelerometer and GPS data can demarcate childhood physical activity locations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical activity is a health-enhancing behavior, but few adolescents achieve the recommended levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Understanding how adolescents use different built environment spaces for physical activity and activity varies by location could help in designing effective interventions to promote moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The objective of this study was to describe the locations where adolescents engage in physical activity and compare traditional intensity-based measures with continuous activity when describing built environment use patterns among adolescents. METHODS: Eighty adolescents aged 11-14 years recruited from community health and recreation centers. Adolescents wore accelerometers (Actigraph GT3X) and global positioning system receivers (QStarz BT-Q1000XT) for two separate weeks to record their physical activity levels and locations. Accelerometer data provided a continuous measure of physical activity and intensity-based measures (sedentary time, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity). Physical activity was mapped by land-use classification (home, school, park, playground, streets {\&} sidewalks, other) using geographic information systems and this location-based activity was assessed for both continuous and intensity-based physical activity derived from mixed-effects models which accounted for repeated measures and clustering effects within person, date, school, and town. RESULTS: Mean daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was 22minutes, mean sedentary time was 134minutes. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity occurred in bouts lasting up to 15minutes. Compared to being at home, being at school, on the streets and sidewalks, in parks, and playgrounds were all associated with greater odds of being in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and achieving higher overall activity levels. Playground use was associated with the highest physical activity level (beta=172 activity counts per minute, SE=4, p{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}0.0001) and greatest odds of being in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (odds ratio 8.3, 95{\%} confidence interval 4.8-14.2). CONCLUSION: Adolescents were more likely to engage in physical activity, and achieved their highest physical activity levels, when using built environments located outdoors. Novel objective methods for determining physical activity can provide insight into adolescents' spatial physical activity patterns, which could help guide physical activity interventions. Promoting zoning and health policies that encourage the design and regular use of outdoor spaces may offer another promising opportunity for increasing adolescent physical activity.},

abstract = {Studies of air pollution effects during pregnancy generally only consider exposure in the outdoor air at the home address. We aimed to compare exposure models differing in their ability to account for the spatial resolution of pollutants, space-time activity and indoor air pollution levels. We recruited 40 pregnant women in the Grenoble urban area, France, who carried a Global Positioning System (GPS) during up to 3 weeks; in a subgroup, indoor measurements of fine particles (PM2.5) were conducted at home (n = 9) and personal exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was assessed using passive air samplers (n = 10). Outdoor concentrations of NO2, and PM2.5 were estimated from a dispersion model with a fine spatial resolution. Women spent on average 16 h per day at home. Considering only outdoor levels, for estimates at the home address, the correlation between the estimate using the nearest background air monitoring station and the estimate from the dispersion model was high (r = 0.93) for PM2.5 and moderate (r = 0.67) for NO2. The model incorporating clean GPS data was less correlated with the estimate relying on raw GPS data (r = 0.77) than the model ignoring space-time activity (r = 0.93). PM2.5 outdoor levels were not to moderately correlated with estimates from the model incorporating indoor measurements and space-time activity (r = -0.10 to 0.47), while NO2 personal levels were not correlated with outdoor levels (r = -0.42 to 0.03). In this urban area, accounting for space-time activity little influenced exposure estimates; in a subgroup of subjects (n = 9), incorporating indoor pollution levels seemed to strongly modify them.

An important yet currently underrepresented theme of IVDR-based studies is the relationship between the risk of accident involvement and exposure variables that differentiate various driving conditions. Using an extensive commercial data set, we develop a methodology for the extraction of exposure metrics from location trajectories and estimate a range of multivariate logistic regression models in a case-control study design. We achieve high model fit (Nagelkerke's R-2 0.646, Hosmer-Lemeshow significance 0.848) and gain insights into the non-linear relationship between mileage and accident risk. We validate our results with official accident statistics and outline further research opportunities.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active commuting may make an important contribution to population health. Accurate measures of these behaviours are required, but it is unknown how self-reported estimates compare to those derived from objective measures. We sought to develop methods for objectively deriving time spent in specific travel behaviours from a combination of locational and activity data, and to assess the convergent validity of two self-reported estimates. METHODS: In 2010 and 2011, a sub-sample of participants from the Commuting and Health in Cambridge study concurrently completed objective monitoring using combined heart rate and movement sensors and global positioning system devices and reported their past-week commuting in a questionnaire (modes used, and usual time spent walking and cycling per trip) and in a day-by-day diary (all modes and durations). Automated and manual approaches were used to objectively identify total time spent using active and motorised modes. Agreement between self-reported and objectively-derived times was assessed using Lin's concordance coefficients, Bland-Altman plots and signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Compared to objective assessments, day-by-day diary estimates of time spent using active modes on the commute were overestimated by a mean of 1.1 minutes/trip (95{\%} limits of agreement (LOA): -7.7 to 9.9, p < 0.001). The magnitude of overestimation was slightly larger, but not significant (p = 0.247), when walking or cycling was used alone (mean: 2.4 minutes/trip, 95{\%} LOA: -6.8 to 11.5). Total time spent on the commute was overestimated by a mean of 1.9 minutes/trip (95{\%} LOA: -15.3 to 19.0, p < 0.001). The mean differences between self-reported usual time and objective estimates were -1.1 minutes/trip (95{\%} LOA: -8.7 to 6.4) for cycling and +2.4 minutes/trip (95{\%} LOA: -10.9 to 15.7) for walking. Mean differences between usual and daily estimates of time were <1 minute/trip for both walking and cycling. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel method of combining objective data to identify time spent using active and motorised modes, and total time spent commuting. Compared to objectively-derived times, self-reported times spent active commuting were slightly overestimated with wide LOA, suggesting that they should be used with caution to infer aggregate weekly quantities of activity on the commute at the individual level.},

abstract = {Quantifying human mobility has significant consequences for studying physical activity, exposure to pathogens, and generating more realistic infectious disease models. Location-aware technologies such as Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled devices are used increasingly as a gold standard for mobility research. The main goal of this observational study was to compare and contrast the information obtained through GPS and semi-structured interviews (SSI) to assess issues affecting data quality and, ultimately, our ability to measure fine-scale human mobility. A total of 160 individuals, ages 7 to 74, from Iquitos, Peru, were tracked using GPS data-loggers for 14 days and later interviewed using the SSI about places they visited while tracked. A total of 2,047 and 886 places were reported in the SSI and identified by GPS, respectively. Differences in the concordance between methods occurred by location type, distance threshold (within a given radius to be considered a match) selected, GPS data collection frequency (i.e., 30, 90 or 150 seconds) and number of GPS points near the SSI place considered to define a match. Both methods had perfect concordance identifying each participant's house, followed by 80-100{\%} concordance for identifying schools and lodgings, and 50-80{\%} concordance for residences and commercial and religious locations. As the distance threshold selected increased, the concordance between SSI and raw GPS data increased (beyond 20 meters most locations reached their maximum concordance). Processing raw GPS data using a signal-clustering algorithm decreased overall concordance to 14.3{\%}. The most common causes of discordance as described by a sub-sample (n=101) with whom we followed-up were GPS units being accidentally off (30{\%}), forgetting or purposely not taking the units when leaving home (24.8{\%}), possible barriers to the signal (4.7{\%}) and leaving units home to recharge (4.6{\%}). We provide a quantitative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of both methods for capturing fine-scale human mobility.},

This study aimed to quantify who children spend their time with when indoors or outdoors and associations with moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). METHODS: Participants were 427 children aged 10-11 from Bristol, UK. Physical activity was recorded using an accelerometer (Actigraph GT1M) and matched to Global Positioning System receiver (Garmin Foretrex 201) data to differentiate indoor and outdoor location. Children self-reported who they spent time with after school until bed-time using a diary. Each 10 second epoch was coded as indoors or outdoors and for 'who with' (alone, friend, brother/sister, mum/dad, other grown-up) creating 10 possible physical activity contexts. Time spent and MVPA were summarised for each context. Associations between time spent in the different contexts and MVPA were examined using multiple linear regression adjusting for daylight, age, deprivation and standardised body mass index. RESULTS: During the after school period, children were most often with their mum/dad or alone, especially when indoors. When outdoors more time was spent with friends (girls: 32.1{\%}; boys: 28.6{\%}) than other people or alone. Regression analyses suggested hours outdoors with friends were positively associated with minutes of MVPA for girls (beta-coefficient [95{\%} CI]: 17.4 [4.47, 30.24]) and boys (17.53 [2.76, 32.31]). Being outdoors with brother/sister was associated with MVPA for girls (21.2 [14.17, 28.25]) but not boys. Weaker associations were observed for time indoors with friends (girls: 4.61 [1.37, 7.85]; boys: (7.42 [2.99, 11.85]) and other adults (girls: 5.33 [2.95, 7.71]; boys: (4.44 [1.98, 6.90]). Time spent alone was not associated with MVPA regardless of gender or indoor/outdoor location. CONCLUSIONS: Time spent outdoors with other children is an important source of MVPA after school. Interventions to increase physical activity may benefit from fostering friendship groups and limiting the time children spend alone.},

subjects in the Oklahoma Urban Air Toxics Study (OUATS) for
automatic logging of their location as they went about their
normal daily activities. The location information obtained by the
GPS units had an uncertainty of about 10-20 m, which was
sufficiently precise to track subjects' movements on trips outside

primarily related to reduced battery life, the units operated for
only about 30{\%} of the total monitoring time attempted in 25
trials. ne GPS data were compared to time-activity diaries kept by
the subjects. In almost all cases, the GPS data confirmed all
travel events reported in the subjects' diaries. Additionally, in
five out of five trials in which die logging period covered most
or all of the subjects' daytime activities, at least one travel
event that was not recorded in the diary was detected by GPS.
Notwithstanding die limitations of present technology, GPS was
found to be a promising means for tracking of research subjects in

The highest particulate emissions were observed from the Euro III and Euro IV buses and the lowest from the ethanol and CNG-fueled buses, which emitted BC only during acceleration. The organics emitted from the CNG-fueled buses were clearly less oxidized compared to the other bus types. The bus line experiments showed that lowest emissions were obtained from the ethanol-fueled buses whereas large variation existed between individual buses of the same type indicating that the operating conditions by drivers had large effect on the emissions.},

abstract = {Travelling to and from school is a regular part of life for most children. Such movement can also have important social, economic and environmental implications for both individuals and wider society. This paper uses innovative methods to examine the complexity of the school journey, and to relate it to exposure to air pollution and engagement with the environment through which children pass. Some 30 lower secondary school pupils used mobile phone and Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to record their routes to and from school in four study periods. They were asked to take photographs and write text messages relating to their route, and these data were then linked to modelled air pollution on the routes through which pupils travelled. Results demonstrate that for most children the journey to and from school is highly variable and contingent on other factors. Pupils that travelled independently (on foot, by bike or by bus) were most likely to engage with their immediate environment, and small variations in route choice had significant effects on the cumulative exposure to air pollution. It is argued that the results shed new light on the everyday experience of the school journey, and have implications for health promotion and transport planning in towns.},

Newly available technology may offer a solution. This pilot study is focused on the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a three-month use of Global Positioning System (GPS) by care receivers and caregivers. Method: Numbers and percentages of participants with positive responses to self-report questions were calculated. Differences between the pre- and post-test scores of role-overload and worry were tested with paired t -tests and effect-sizes were calculated. Results: Of the 33 dyads of care receivers and caregivers, 28 remained in the study (dropout rate 15{\%}). The majority of the caregivers was able to use the technology and integrate the use into their daily routines and would recommend the use of GPS. Almost half of the participants with dementia experienced more freedom and were less worried when they were outside unaccompanied, a quarter mentioned that they were more outside independently and a fifth that they had less conflicts with their caregiver after three months. Caregivers showed a trend to feel less worried, especially caregivers who could reach their relative using the telephone connection. No changes in caregivers’ feelings of role-overload were found. Conclusion: The GPS device used in this study seems to be promising for people in early stages of dementia and their informal caregivers. A next step is to carry out a randomized controlled trial.},

In this paper, we propose the use of such a database for the analysis of physical activities during cycling. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to use cross-correlations between the heart rate and the altitude gradient to evaluate the delay between these variables and to study its time evolution. The data acquired during 22 identical cycling routes, each about 130 km long, include more than 6,700 segments of length 60 s recorded with varying sampling periods. General statistical and digital signal processing methods used include mathematical tools to reject gross errors, resampling using selected interpolation methods, digital filtering of noise signal components, and estimating cross-correlations between the position data and the physiological signals. The results of a regression between GPS and physiological data include the estimate of the time delay between the heart rate change and gradient altitude of about 7.5 s and its decrease during each training route. © 2013 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

abstract = {Background: Infectious diseases pose increasing threats to public health with increasing population density and more and more sophisticated social networks. While efforts continue in studying the large scale dissemination of contagious diseases, individual-based activity and behaviour study benefits not only disease transmission modelling but also the control, containment, and prevention decision making at the local scale. The potential for using tracking technologies to capture detailed space-time trajectories and model individual behaviour is increasing rapidly, as technological advances enable the manufacture of small, lightweight, highly sensitive, and affordable receivers and the routine use of location-aware devices has become widespread (e.g., smart cellular phones). The use of low-cost tracking devices in medical research has also been proved effective by more and more studies. This study describes the use of tracking devices to collect data of space-time trajectories and the spatiotemporal processing of such data to facilitate micro-scale flu transmission study. We also reports preliminary findings on activity patterns related to chances of influenza infection in a pilot study. Methods: Specifically, this study employed A-GPS tracking devices to collect data on a university campus. Spatiotemporal processing was conducted for data cleaning and segmentation. Processed data was validated with traditional activity diaries. The A-GPS data set was then used for visual explorations including density surface visualization and connection analysis to examine space-time activity patterns in relation to chances of influenza infection. Results: When compared to diary data, the segmented tracking data demonstrated to be an effective alternative and showed greater accuracies in time as well as the details of routes taken by participants. A comparison of space-time activity patterns between participants who caught seasonal influenza and those who did not revealed interesting patterns. Conclusions: This study proved that tracking technology an effective technique for obtaining data for micro-scale influenza transmission research. The findings revealed micro-scale transmission hotspots on a university campus and provided insights for local control and prevention strategies.},

abstract = {Background: Physical activity is an essential element in reducing the prevalence of obesity, but much is unknown about the intensity and location of physical activity among youth-this is important because adolescent health behaviors are predictive of behaviors in adults. Purpose: This study aims to identify the locations where youth moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) occurs, and to examine how MVPA varies according to urbanicity (urban, suburban, rural). Methods: Participants included adolescent students (N=380, aged 12-16 years) from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Locations of MVPA were measured using accelerometers and GPS data loggers for up to 7 days. Specialized software was developed to integrate and process the data. Frequencies of MVPA by location were determined, and differences in MVPA were assessed for association with urbanicity. Results: Active commuting accounted for the largest proportion of time in MVPA among urban and suburban students. Rural students achieved most MVPA at school. Other residential locations, shopping centers, and green spaces accounted for a majority of the remaining MVPA. Minutes in MVPA varied significantly overall (196.6 +/- 163.8, 84.9 +/- 103.2, 81.7 +/- 98.2); at school (45.7 +/- 45.2, 18.6 +/- 28.0, 29.8 +/- 39.7); while commuting (110.3 +/- 107.1, 31.5 +/- 55.2, 19.5 +/- 39.7); and at other activity locations (19.7 +/- 27.1, 14.8 +/- 26.8, 12.0 +/- 22.1) and by urbanicity. Conclusions: Findings reveal that the journeys between locations are as important as home and school settings in contributing to greater MVPA in adolescent youth. The relative importance of context as a contributor to MVPA varies with urbanicity. Combining actimetry and GPS data provides a precise link between physical activity measurements and contexts of the built environment.

abstract = {Vehicle emissions are identified as a major source of air pollution in metropolitan areas. Emission control programs in many cities have been implemented as part of larger scale transport policy interventions to control traffic pollutants and reduce public health risks. These interventions include provision of traffic-free and low emission zones and congestion charging. Various studies have investigated the impact of urban street configurations, such as street canyon in urban centers, on pollutants dispersion and roadside air quality. However, there are few investigations in the literature to study the impact of change of fleet composition and street canyon effects on the on-road pollutants concentrations and associated roadside pedestrian exposure to the pollutants. This study presents an experimental investigation on the traffic related gas and particle pollutants in and near major streets in one of the most developed business districts in Hong Kong, known as Central. Both street canyon and open roadway configurations were included in the study design. Mobile measurement techniques were deployed to monitor both on-road and roadside pollutants concentrations at different times of the day and on different days of a week. Multiple traffic counting points were also established to concurrently collect data on traffic volume and fleet composition on individual streets. Street canyon effects were evident with elevated on-road pollutants concentrations. Diesel vehicles were found to be associated with observed pollutant levels. Roadside black carbon concentrations were found to correlate with their on-road levels but with reduced concentrations. However, ultrafine particles showed very high concentrations in roadside environment with almost unity of roadside/on-road ratios possibly due to the accumulation of primary emissions and secondary PM formation. The results from the study provide useful information for the effective urban transport design and bus route reorganization to minimize the impact of traffic emissions on the urban air quality and public health. Observations on the elevated ultrafine particle concentrations in roadside pedestrian levels also demonstrate the urgent need to improve roadside air quality to reduce pedestrians' health risks especially inside street canyon. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Study Design Observational prospective cohort study with 1-year follow-up. Objectives To investigate the relationship between eccentric hip abduction strength and the development of patellofemoral pain (PFP) in novice runners during a self-structured running regime. Background Recent research indicates that gluteal muscle weakness exists in individuals with PFP. However, current prospective research has been limited to the evaluation of isometric strength, producing inconsistent findings. Considering that hip muscles, including the gluteus maximus and medius, activate eccentrically to control hip and pelvic motion during weight-bearing activities such as running, the potential link between eccentric strength and PFP risk should be evaluated. Methods Eight hundred thirty-two novice runners were included at baseline, and 629 participants were included in the final analysis. Maximal eccentric hip abduction strength was measured using a handheld dynamometer prior to initiating a self-structured running program. The diagnostic criteria to classify knee pain as PFP were based on a thorough clinical examination. Participants were followed for 12 months and training characteristics were gathered with a global positioning system. Results Results from the unadjusted generalized linear regression model for cumulative risk at 25 and 50 km indicated differences in cumulative risk of PFP between high strength, normal strength, and low strength (P<.05), with higher strength associated with reduced risk. Conclusion Findings from this study indicate that, among novice runners, a level of peak eccentric hip abduction strength that is higher than normal may reduce the risk of PFP during the first 50 km of a self-structured running program.

abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: There is a paucity of knowledge on the association between different foot posture quantified by Foot Posture Index (FPI) and Quadriceps angle (Q-angle) with development of running-related injuries. Earlier studies investigating these associations did not include an objective measure of the amount of running performed. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate if kilometers to running-related injury (RRI) differ among novice runners with different foot postures and Q-angles when running in a neutral running shoe. METHODS: A 10 week study was conducted including healthy, novice runners. At baseline foot posture was evaluated using the foot posture index (FPI) and the Q-angle was measured. Based on the FPI and Q-angle, right and left feet / knees of the runners were categorized into exposure groups. All participants received a Global Positioning System watch to allow them to quantify running volume and were instructed to run a minimum of two times per week in a conventional, neutral running shoe. The outcome was RRI. RESULTS: Fifty nine novice runners of mixed gender were included. Of these, 13 sustained a running-related injury. No significant difference in cumulative relative risk between persons with pronated feet and neutral feet was found after 125 km of running (Cumulative relative risk = 1.65 [0.65; 4.17], p = 0.29). Similarly, no difference was found between low and neutral Q-angle (Cumulative relative risk = 1.25 [0.49; 3.23], p = 0.63). CONCLUSION: Static foot posture as quantified by FPI and knee alignment as quantified by Q-angle do not seem to affect the risk of injury among novice runners taking up a running regimen wearing a conventional neutral running shoe. These results should be interpreted with caution due to a small sample size. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2a.},

abstract = {Background: Measuring physical at home and away from home is essential for assessing health and well-being, and could help design interventions to increase physical activity. Here, we describe how physical activity at home and away from home can be quantified by combining information from cellular network-based tracking devices and accelerometers. Methods: Thirty-five working adults wore a cellular network-based tracking device and an accelerometer for 6 consecutive days and logged their travel away from home. Performance of the tracking device was determined using the travel log for reference. Tracking device and accelerometer data were merged to compare physical activity at home and away from home. Results: The tracking device detected 98.6{\%} of all away-from-home excursions, accurately measured time away from home and demonstrated few prolonged signal drop-out periods. Most physical activity took place away from home on weekdays, but not on weekends. Subjects were more physically active per unit of time while away from home, particularly on weekends. Conclusions: Cellular network-based tracking devices represent an alternative to global positioning systems for tracking location, and provide information easily integrated with accelerometers to determine where physical activity takes place. Promoting greater time spent away from home may increase physical activity. © 2012 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

Most interventions for getting lost or wandering have in common that they restrict the patient. This is unnecessary when suitable devices, such as technological systems could be used. The objectives of this pilot field study were: 1)To identify different possibilities for preventing getting lost or solving the problems of wandering behaviour in patients with dementia. 2) To determine what functional specifications a system requires to support the problems due to getting lost or wandering in patients with dementia. 3) To put one selected form of technical support into practice and to find out whether this system was experienced as effective. The main findings are that both informal and professional caregivers of patients with dementia point out the need of support for the problems of getting lost or wandering in dementia. Technological systems in which GSM is combined with GPS, could be a solution to the problems encountered by getting lost and wandering behaviour. Patients who are in an early stage of dementia would profit the most of the technological devices.},

The use of these systems in the design and implementation of rehabilitation and return-to-running programs has not yet been elucidated. Objective: To demonstrate the application of GPS technology in the management of return to play in elite-club Rugby Union. Design: Case series. Setting: Professional Rugby Union club team. Participants: 8 elite Rugby Union players (age 27.86 +/- 4.78 y, height 1.85 +/- 0.08 m, weight 99.14 +/- 9.96 kg). Intervention: Players wore GPS devices for the entire duration of a club game. Main Outcome Measures: Variables of locomotion speed and distance were measured. Results: Differences in physical demands between playing positions were observed for all variables. Conclusions: An analysis of the position-specific physical demands measured by GPS provides key information regarding the level and volume of loads sustained by a player in a game environment. Using this information, sports-medicine practitioners can develop rehabilitation and return-to-running protocols specific to the player position to optimize safe return to play.},

abstract = {Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an important component in the management of respiratory diseases. The effectiveness of PR is dependent upon adherence to exercise training recommendations. The study of exercise adherence is thus a key step towards the optimization of PR programs. To date, mostly indirect measures, such as rates of participation, completion, and attendance, have been used to determine adherence to PR. The purpose of the present protocol is to describe how continuous data tracking technology can be used to measure adherence to a prescribed aerobic training intensity on a second-by-second basis. In our investigations, adherence has been defined as the percent time spent within a specified target heart rate range. As such, using a combination of hardware and software, heart rate is measured, tracked, and recorded during cycling second-by-second for each participant, for each exercise session. Using statistical software, the data is subsequently extracted and analyzed. The same protocol can be applied to determine adherence to other measures of exercise intensity, such as time spent at a specified wattage, level, or speed on the cycle ergometer. Furthermore, the hardware and software is also available to measure adherence to other modes of training, such as the treadmill, elliptical, stepper, and arm ergometer. The present protocol, therefore, has a vast applicability to directly measure adherence to aerobic exercise.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Adolescents do not achieve recommended levels of physical activity. Crime is believed to be a barrier to physical activity among youth, but findings are inconsistent. This study compares the spatial distribution of crime incidences and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among adolescents in Massachusetts between 2011 and 2012, and examines the correlation between crime and MVPA.

METHODS: Eighty adolescents provided objective physical activity (accelerometer) and location (Global Positioning Systems) data. Crime report data were obtained from the city police department. Data were mapped using geographic information systems, and crime and MVPA densities were calculated using kernel density estimations. Spearman's correlation tested for associations between crime and MVPA.

RESULTS: Overall, 1694 reported crimes and 16,702min of MVPA were included in analyses. A strong positive correlation was present between crime and adolescent MVPA ($\rho$=0.72, p<0.0001). Crime remained positively associated with MVPA in locations falling within the lowest quartile ($\rho$=0.43, p<0.0001) and highest quartile ($\rho$=0.32, p<0.0001) of crime density.

CONCLUSIONS: This study found a strong positive association between crime and adolescent MVPA, despite research suggesting the opposite relationship. This counterintuitive finding may be explained by the logic of a common destination: neighborhood spaces which are desirable destinations and promote physical activity may likewise attract crime.},

This study compared youth-identified neighborhood (YIN) boundaries to census-defined neighborhood (CDN) boundaries, and determined how the amount of time spent and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels compared within both boundary types. Methods: Adolescents aged 11-14 years were asked to identify their neighborhood boundaries using a map. Objective location and physical activity data collected using Global Positioning System (GPS) devices and accelerometers were used to calculate the amount of time spent and MVPA within youth-identified and census-defined neighborhood boundaries. Paired bivariate analyses compared mean area (meters squared), percent of total time, daily MVPA (minutes), time density (minutes/m(2)) and MVPA density (minutes/m(2)) for both boundary types. Results: Youth-identified neighborhoods (1,821,705 m(2)) and census-defined neighborhoods (1,277,181 m(2)) were not significantly different in area, p = 0.30. However, subjects spent more time in youth-identified neighborhoods (80.3{\%}) than census-defined neighborhoods (58.4{\%}), p {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.0001, and engaged in more daily MVPA within youth-identified neighborhoods (14.7 minutes) than census-defined neighborhoods (9.5 minutes), p {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.0001. After adjusting for boundary area, MVPA density (minutes of MVPA per squared meter of area) remained significantly greater for youth-identified neighborhoods (2.4 x 10(-4) minutes/m(2)) than census-defined neighborhoods (1.4 x 10(-4) minutes/m(2)), p = 0.02. Conclusions: Adolescents perceive their neighborhoods to be similar in size to census-defined neighborhoods. However, youth-identified neighborhoods better capture the locations in which adolescents spend time and engage in physical activity. Asking adolescents to identify their neighborhood boundaries is a feasible and valuable method for identifying the spaces that adolescents are exposed to and use to be physically active.},

abstract = {Purpose: This paper describes proposed health care services innovations, provided by a system called CAALYX (Complete Ambient Assisted Living eXperiment). CAALYX aimed to provide healthcare innovation by extending the state-of-the-art in tele-healthcare, by focusing on increasing the confidence of elderly people living autonomously, by building on the knowledge base of the most common disorders and respective characteristic vital sign changes for this age group. Methods: A review of the state-of-the-art on health care services was carried out. Then, extensive research was conducted on the particular needs of the elderly in relation to home health services that, if offered to them, could improve their day life by giving them greater confidence and autonomy. To achieve this, we addressed issues associated with the gathering of clinical data and interpretation of these data, as well as possibilities of automatically triggering appropriate clinical measures. Considering this initial work we started the identification of initiatives, ongoing works and technologies that could be used for the development of the system. After that, the implementation of CAALYX was done. Findings: The innovation in CAALYX system considers three main areas of contribution: (i) The Roaming Monitoring System that is used to collect information on the well-being of the elderly users; (ii) The Home Monitoring System that is aimed at helping the elders independently living at home being implemented by a device (a personal computer or a set top box) that supports the connection of sensors and video cameras that may be used for monitoring and for interaction with the elder; (iii) The Central Care Service and Monitoring System that is implemented by a Caretaker System where attention and care services are provided to elders, where actors as Caretakers, Doctors and Relatives are logically linked to elders. Innovations in each of these areas are presented here. Conclusions: The ageing European society is placing an added burden on future generations, as the 'elderly-to-working-age-people' ratio is set to steadily increase in the future. Nowadays, quality of life and fitness allows for most older persons to have an active life well into their eighties. Furthermore, many older persons prefer to live in their own house and choose their own lifestyle. The CAALYX system can have a clear impact in increasing older persons' autonomy, by ensuring that they do not need to leave their preferred environment in order to be properly monitored and taken care of. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study examines the usefulness of
complementing accelerometry-based physical activity measurement
with spatial data from portable global positioning system (GPS)
units to determine where physical activity occurs. Methods: First,
using the geographic distribution of data points and Bland-Altman
plots, we examined GPS units' validity and interunit reliability
by measuring the distance to a geodetic point. We also assessed
interunit reliability by comparing GPS data collected in three
built environment contexts. Second, we conducted a pilot study in
which 35 participants wore GPS units and accelerometers in
free-living conditions for 3 d. Moderate and vigorous physical
activity (MVPA) bouts were matched to GPS data. We classified each
bout as occurring inside or outside the participant's home
neighborhood. Using unpaired t-tests and Fisher's exact tests, we
compared neighborhood attributes for participants having the
majority of MVPA bouts within their home neighborhood, relative to
those with most bouts away from their home neighborhood. Results:
Average distance from each unit to the geodetic point was 3.02 m
(SD 2.51). Average bias among units using Bland-Altman plots was
0.90 m, ranging from -0.22 to 1.86 m, within the limits of
agreement. For interunit reliability in the built environment
contexts, the mean distance difference among units ranged between
10.7 m (SD 11.9) and 20.1 m (SD 21.8). For the pilot study
involving participants, GPS data were available for 59.3{\%} of all
bouts (67{\%} of MVPA time), of which 46{\%} were in the participants'
neighborhood. Participants obtaining most of their MVPA in their
neighborhoods tend to live in areas with higher population
density, housing unit density, street connectivity, and more
public parks. Conclusion: Data recorded by portable GPS units is
sufficiently precise to track participants' movements. Successful
matching of activity monitor and locational data suggests GPS is a
promising tool for complementing accelerometry-based physical
activity measures. Our pilot analysis shows evidence that the
relationship between environment and activity can be clarified by
examining where physical activity occurs.},

DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with 35 adults over age 50, which used an assistive device and lived in King County, Washington, U.S. In addition, participants wore global positioning systems (GPS) devices for 3 days prior to the interview. The GPS maps were used as prompts during the interviews. Open coding of the 35 interviews using latent content analysis resulted in key themes and subthemes that achieved consensus between coders. Two investigators independently coded the text of each interview. RESULTS: Participants were on average of 67 years of age (range: 50-86) and predominantly used canes (57{\%}), walkers (57{\%}), or wheelchairs (46{\%}). Key themes pertained to curb ramp availability and condition, sidewalk availability and condition, hills, aesthetics, lighting, ramp availability, weather, presence and features of crosswalks, availability of resting places and shelter on streets, paved or smooth walking paths, safety, and traffic on roads. IMPLICATIONS: A variety of built environment barriers and facilitators to neighborhood-based activity exist for midlife and older adults with mobility disabilities. Preparing our neighborhood environments for an aging population that uses assistive devices will be important to foster independence and health.},

abstract = {The article presents an overview of the design and application of a real-time patient routing system, based on barcode and local area network technology, that was designed to track the progress of patients during the perioperative process. We present data on all patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. Patients' progress during their surgical stay was recorded at 17 strategic events using this real-time patient tracking technology. These times were used to identify inefficiencies in the perioperative process by identifying bottlenecks and areas of high variation. We found that both raw and actual operating room (OR) utilization efficiency was less than 50{\%}. Points of high variation in a patient's progress occurred during the time from admit to the hospital until the patient was ready for the OR; the time from when a patient was ready for the OR until they were called for; and the time a patient spends in the OR preoperative holding room. Causes for variation were identified and traced back to individual procedures, activities, and work processes. Multidisciplinary improvement teams were created to improve the pinpointed problem areas. The real-time patient routing system is a process that has proven to be highly valuable to all participants in the surgical process in bringing about rational, data driven efficiencies in perioperative services.

post-match recovery and readiness to train are unclear. Therefore,
we examined the relationship between Global Positioning System

Kinase (CK) concentrations and peak power output (PPO; during the
countermovement jump) at 24 h and 48 h post-match. Fifteen English
Premier League reserve team players were examined over 1-4
matches. Measurements of CK and PPO were taken before (24 h prior
to match-play) and after (+24 h and +48 h) each game during which
movement demands were quantified using 10 Hz GPS data. High
intensity distance covered (r = 0386, p = 0.029; r =-0349; p =
0.050), high intensity distance covered.min(-1) (r = 0365, p =
0.040; r =-0.364, p = 0.040), high speed running distance (r =

significantly related to Delta CK and Delta PPO at +24 h
post-match, respectively. No relationships were observed between
any match variables and Delta CK and Delta PPO after +48 h of
recovery. These findings highlight that high intensity match
activities are related to Delta CK and Delta PPO in the 24 h, but
not 48 h, following soccer match-play. Such information is likely
of interest to those responsible for the design of soccer player's
training schedules in the days following a match. (c) 2015

abstract = {Background: Depression is a common, burdensome, often recurring mental health disorder that frequently goes undetected and untreated. Mobile phones are ubiquitous and have an increasingly large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone global positioning systems (GPS) and usage sensors, and their use in identifying depressive symptom severity. Methods: A total of 40 adult participants were recruited from the general community to carry a mobile phone with a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for 2 weeks. Of these participants, 28 had sufficient sensor data received to conduct analysis. At the beginning of the 2-week period, participants completed a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from GPS location and phone usage data. Results: A number of features from GPS data were related to depressive symptom severity, including circadian movement (regularity in 24-hour rhythm;  r =-.63,  P =.005), normalized entropy (mobility between favorite locations;  r =-.58,  P =.012), and location variance (GPS mobility independent of location;  r =-.58,  P =.012). Phone usage features, usage duration, and usage frequency were also correlated ( r =.54,  P =.011, and  r =.52,  P =.015, respectively). Using the normalized entropy feature and a classifier that distinguished participants with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score {\&}{\#}8805;5) from those without (PHQ-9 score {\&}{\#}60;5), we achieved an accuracy of 86.5{\%}. Furthermore, a regression model that used the same feature to estimate the participants{\&}{\#}8217; PHQ-9 scores obtained an average error of 23.5{\%}. Conclusions: Features extracted from mobile phone sensor data, including GPS and phone usage, provided behavioral markers that were strongly related to depressive symptom severity. While these findings must be replicated in a larger study among participants with confirmed clinical symptoms, they suggest that phone sensors offer numerous clinical opportunities, including continuous monitoring of at-risk populations with little patient burden and interventions that can provide just-in-time outreach.

@article{santos_diarrhea_2014,
abstract = {Background: Acute diarrhea is the second leading cause of mortality among children under 5 years of age in developing countries. The pathogen most strongly associated with diarrhea is rotavirus followed by enteric pathogens such as bacteria, helminthes and protozoan. Adequate sanitation and water supply contribute to decrease acute diarrhea incidence of most etiologic agents, although vaccination remains the most important intervention to control rotavirus acute diarrhea. This study aimed to describe environmental conditions and analyze spatially the acute diarrhea and intestinal infection among rotavirus vaccinated infants from Laranjeiras-Sergipe, Brazil. Methods: Children were enrolled between 2 and 11 months of age and followed through 12 months. Demographic, socioeconomic and environmental data were obtained from a questionnaire, and immunization data were obtained from children vaccination card. Children stool samples were collected each month in order to run laboratory analyses. The household spatial localization was obtained by using a Global Positioning System (GPS). Spatial analysis was performed using the TerraView computer program and Kernel intensity estimation. Results: A total of 1,113 stool samples were collected with 80 being diarrhea associated. Diarrhea incidence rate was 0.5 +/- 1.0 episodes/child/year. The overall infection rates by Ascaris lumbricoides, Endolimax nana, Giardia lamblia and rotavirus were 5.1{\%}, 3.0{\%}, 0.9{\%} and 2.6{\%}, respectively. 3.8{\%} of diarrhea-associated stool samples were positive for rotavirus and 11.3{\%} were positive for helminths and protozoans. There were some changes on spatial distribution of intestinal infections and diarrhea episodes along the four trimesters evaluated. Conclusions: The studied infants live equally in precarious conditions of sanitation which probably explain the significant rates of parasitic infections appearing in early life. The low acute diarrhea incidence in the studied rotavirus vaccinated population and the low number of symptomatic rotavirus infection may indicate vaccination efficacy to prevent acute diarrhea among young children in a poor environmental sanitary setting.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: There is a need for accurate, reliable, and feasible methods for determining route distances in physically active transportation. The aim of this study, therefore, was to scrutinize if distances of commuting routes drawn by physically active commuters and measured with a digital curvimetric distance measurement device could serve such a purpose. METHODS: Participants were recruited when walking or bicycling in the inner urban area of Stockholm, Sweden. Questionnaires and individually adjusted maps were sent twice to the participants (n = 133). Commuting routes from home to work were drawn on the maps. These were measured using a digital curvimetric distance measurer that was carefully controlled for validity and reproducibility. Marked points of origin and destination were checked for validity and reproducibility using stated addresses and address geocoding systems. Nineteen participants were followed with a global positioning system (GPS) to control for validity of drawn routes. An analysis of the effect on distance measurements of any deviations between GPS route tracings and drawn routes was undertaken. RESULTS: No order effects were noted on distance measurements, and the test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.999 (P ĝ‰Currency sign 0.001). The map markings of route origins and destinations were accurate and reproducible. GPS tracings of actual commuting routes taken (n = 19) as displayed in six cases had slight deviations from the routes drawn by the commuters on maps. However, these deviations played an insubstantial role (0.4{\%}) for the distances measured. CONCLUSION: When physically active commuters draw their commuting routes on maps, they create a valid and reproducible basis for route distance measurements. In combination with an accurate digital curvimetric distance-measuring device, a potential criterion method for measuring the commuting route distance is established. © 2009 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

DESIGN Proof of concept involving three field trials of 30, 30, and 21 days. SETTING Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan and surrounding rural region. PARTICIPANTS Three participants (48-year-old man, 33-year-old woman, and 27-year-old male), none with any functional limitations. MEASUREMENTS Cellular telephones were used to detect in-home position and in-community location and to measure physical activity. Within the home, cellular telephones and Bluetooth transmitters (beacons) were used to locate participants at room-level resolution. Outside the home, the same cellular telephones and global positioning system (GPS) technology were used to locate participants at a community-level resolution. Physical activity was simultaneously measured using the cellular telephone accelerometer. RESULTS This approach had face validity to measure activity and lifespace. More importantly, this system could measure the spatial and temporal organization of these metrics. For example, an individual's lifespace was automatically calculated across multiple time intervals. Behavioral time budgets showing how people allocate time to specific regions within the home were also automatically generated.

However, the use of GPS in free-living conditions is not without challenges and the aim of this study was to test the dynamic accuracy of a portable GPS device under real-world environmental conditions, for four modes of transport, and using three data collection intervals. We selected four routes on different bearings, passing through a variation of environmental conditions in the City of Copenhagen, Denmark, to test the dynamic accuracy of the Qstarz BT-Q1000XT GPS device. Each route consisted of a walk, bicycle, and vehicle lane in each direction. The actual width of each walking, cycling, and vehicle lane was digitized as accurately as possible using ultra-high-resolution aerial photographs as background. For each trip, we calculated the percentage that actually fell within the lane polygon, and within the 2.5, 5, and 10m buffers respectively, as well as the mean and median error in meters. Our results showed that 49.6{\%} of all 68,000 GPS points fell within 2.5m of the expected location, 78.7{\%} fell within 10m and the median error was 2.9m. The median error during walking trips was 3.9, 2.0m for bicycle trips, 1.5m for bus, and 0.5m for car. The different area types showed considerable variation in the median error: 0.7m in open areas, 2.6m in half-open areas, and 5.2m in urban canyons. The dynamic spatial accuracy of the tested device is not perfect, but we feel that it is within acceptable limits for larger population studies. Longer recording periods, for a larger population are likely to reduce the potentially negative effects of measurement inaccuracy. Furthermore, special care should be taken when the environment in which the study takes place could compromise the GPS signal.},

In this study, we assessed the food environment in a 6-county rural region of Texas (11,567 km2) through ground-truthed methods that included direct observation and on-site Global Positioning System technology to examine the relationship between neighborhood inequalities (e.g., socioeconomic deprivation and minority composition) and network distance from all 101 rural neighborhoods to the nearest food store (FS). Neighborhood deprivation was determined from socioeconomic characteristics using 2000 census block group (CBG) data. Network distances were calculated from the population-weighted center of each CBG to the nearest supermarket, grocery, convenience, and discount store. Multiple regression models examined associations among deprivation, minority composition, population density, and network distance to the nearest FS. The median distance to the nearest supermarket was 14.9 km one way (range 0.12 to 54.0 km). The distance decreased with increasing deprivation, minority composition, and population density. The worst deprived neighborhoods with the greatest minority composition had better potential spatial access to the nearest FS. For >20{\%} of all rural residents, their neighborhoods were at least 17.7 km from the nearest supermarket or full-line grocery or 7.6 km from the nearest convenience store. This makes food shopping a challenge, especially in rural areas that lack public transportation and where many have no vehicular access. Knowledge of potential access to the food environment is essential for combining environmental approaches and health interventions so that families, especially those in rural areas, can make healthier food choices.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the more common behavioral manifestations of dementia-related disorders is severe problems with out-of-home mobility. Various efforts have been attempted to attain a better understanding of mobility behavior, but most studies are based on institutionalized patients and the assessment usually relies on reports of caregivers and institutional staff, using observational approaches, activity monitoring, or behavioral checklists. The current manuscript describes the research protocol of a project that measures mobility in Alzheimer's disease and related cognitive disorders in an innovative way, by taking advantage of advanced tracking technologies. METHODS/DESIGN: Participants are 360 demented persons, mildly cognitively impaired persons, and unimpaired controls aged {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} or = 65 in Israel and Germany. Data regarding space-time activities will be collected via a GPS tracking kit for a period of 4 weeks in 3 waves (one year apart) with the same participants (using a repeated measures design). Participants will be interviewed by use of a battery of instruments prior to and following GPS data collection. Further, a family member will complete a questionnaire both before and after data tracking. Statistical analyses will strive to explain differences in mobility based on a wide range of socio-structural, clinical, affect-related and environmental variables. We will also assess the impact of the use of advanced tracking technology on the quality of life of dementia patients and care givers, as well as its potential as a diagnostic tool. Systematic assessment of ethical issues involved in the use of tracking technology will be an integral component of the project. DISCUSSION: This project will be able to make a substantial contribution to basic as well as applied and clinical aspects in the area of mobility and cognitive impairment research. The innovative technologies applied in this study will allow for assessing a range of dimensions of out-of-home mobility, and provide better quality data.},

abstract = {Until recently, the assessment of outdoor mobility of the elderly relied mainly on self-administered time-space diaries or on reports of family caregivers and institutional staff, using observational approaches, activity monitoring, or behavioral checklists. In recent years, however, the rapid development and availability of small, inexpensive, and reliable tracking devices has led to a growing volume of research that uses this technology as a tool for data collection in various disciplines.This paper presents new insights that are now available regarding the outdoor mobility of the elderly due to the analysis of GPS data with automatic scripts and GIS platforms. The data presented are based on the activity of 49 elderly people from the Tel-Aviv Metropolitan area (Israel), who took part in an interdisciplinary project, involving researchers in geography, social work, gerontology, psychology and medicine, that studies the outdoor activities of elderly people in time and space using advanced tracking technologies.Participants were tracked for an average of 28 consecutive days using a location kit that combined GPS with RFID technology. Differences were found in various walking and driving parameters, such as speed, length, timing, and frequency of participants with different levels of cognitive function. The trends present a general decline in out-of-home mobility of elderly people with cognitive impairment and illuminates as well the important role that additional factors as age, gender, and the accessibility to a private car play in determining levels of out-of-home mobility. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTCognitive impairment manifests in changed out-of-home mobility. Until recently, the assessment of outdoor mobility relied on the reports of family care-givers and institutional staff and used observational approaches, activity monitoring or behavioural checklists. This article presents data for 41 mildly demented, mildly cognitively impaired and healthy men and women aged 64{\^{a}}€“90 years in Tel-Aviv (Israel) who took part in an interdisciplinary project, SenTra, that is studying the outdoor activities of elderly people using advanced tracking technologies and that involves researchers from geography, social work, gerontology, psychology and medicine. The participants were tracked for 28 consecutive days using a location kit that combined a global positioning system (GPS) with radio frequency identification. The high-resolution spatial and temporal data enabled detailed analysis of the differences in the timing and distance of the participants' daily outdoor mobility patterns. It was found that the spatial range of the mobility of elderly people with cognitive impairment is severely restricted, with most out-of-home time spent in close proximity to their residences. We conclude that GPS is an advanced research tool able to understand out-of-home behaviour better than was possible with previous methods.},

abstract = {Objective: Studies of the association between transportation barriers and HIV-related health outcomes have shown both positive and negative effects, possibly because a reliable, validated measure of transportation barriers has not been identified. Design: Prospective cohort study of HIV-infected patients in rural Uganda. Methods: Participants were enrolled from the HIV clinic at the regional referral hospital in Mbarara, Uganda as part of the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes (UARTO) Study. We collected the following measures of transportation barriers to HIV clinic: global positioning systems (GPS)-tracked distance measured by driving participants to their homes along their typical route; straight-line GPS distance from clinic to home, calculated with the Great Circle Formula; self-reported travel time; and self-reported travel cost. We assessed inter-measure agreement using linear regression, correlation coefficients and k statistics (by measure quartile) and validated measures by fitting linear regression models to estimate associations with days late for clinic visits. Results: One hundred and eighty-eight participants were tracked with GPS. Seventy-six percent were women, with a median age of 40 years and median CD4 cell count of 193 cells/ml. We found a high correlation between GPS-based distance measures (b ¼ 0.74, P < 0.001, R 2 ¼ 0.92, k ¼ 0.73), but little correlation between GPS-based and self-reported measures (all R 2 0.4). GPS-based measures were associated with days late to clinic (P < 0.001); but neither self-reported measure was associated (P > 0.85). Conclusion: GPS-measured distance to clinic is associated with HIV clinic absenteeism and should be prioritized over self-reported measures to optimally risk-stratify patients accessing care in rural, resource-limited settings.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Health benefits of regular participation in physical activity are well documented but population levels are low. Office layout, and in particular the number and location of office building destinations (eg, print and meeting rooms), may influence both walking time and characteristics of sitting time. No research to date has focused on the role that the layout of the indoor office environment plays in facilitating or inhibiting step counts and characteristics of sitting time. The primary aim of this study was to investigate associations between office layout and physical activity, as well as sitting time using objective measures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: Active buildings is a unique collaboration between public health, built environment and computer science researchers. The study involves objective monitoring complemented by a larger questionnaire arm. UK office buildings will be selected based on a variety of features, including office floor area and number of occupants. Questionnaires will include items on standard demographics, well-being, physical activity behaviour and putative socioecological correlates of workplace physical activity. Based on survey responses, approximately 30 participants will be recruited from each building into the objective monitoring arm. Participants will wear accelerometers (to monitor physical activity and sitting inside and outside the office) and a novel tracking device will be placed in the office (to record participant location) for five consecutive days. Data will be analysed using regression analyses, as well as novel agent-based modelling techniques.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The results of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and scientific presentations. Ethical approval was obtained through the University College London Research Ethics Committee (Reference number 4400/001).},

@article{solanas_m-carer:_2013,
abstract = {Age-related diseases are becoming more prominent due to life expectancy increase in developed countries. Mild cognitive impairment and several types of dementia like Alzheimer's disease are gaining importance both socially and economically. Patients suffering from these diseases have different degrees of autonomy and, thus, different needs. Often, relatives or friends take care of those patients. However, during the first stages of the disease, they still have a high degree of autonomy and frown on the supervision of others. Despite their autonomy, patients could get lost and disoriented. Rapidly determining the location of a lost patient is paramount to reduce the risk of suffering serious injuries. Current solutions to this problem are based on the continuous monitoring of the patient. Such continuous control might be seen by most people as a privacy invasion, and it may discourage patients from using these solutions. In this article we present the concept of m-Carer as a smart mobile device able to privately monitor the movements of patients having diverse degrees of mobility and autonomy. After justifying the need for privacy-aware m-carers due to social and economical reasons, we propose a complete architecture aimed at fulfilling the needs of patients, relatives and healthcare services. Moreover, we show a real implementation of our proposal so as to confirm that it is technically sound and feasible.},

Twenty-two male professional soccer players formed 2 teams (A and B), of similar age, body characteristics, and training experience. The 2 teams played against each other twice with a week interval between. For 3.5 days before the first match, the players of team A followed a high CHO diet that provided 8 g CHO per kg body mass (BM) (HC), whereas team B players followed a low CHO diet that provided 3 g CHO per kg BM (LC) for the same time period. Before the second match the dietary treatment was reversed and followed for the same time period. Training during the study was controlled, and distances covered were measured using global positioning system technology. Every player covered a greater total distance in HC compared with the distance covered in LC (HC: 9,380 +/-},

abstract = {Background: Active travel is a possible method to increase physical activity in children, but the precise contribution of walking to school to daily physical activity is unclear. Purpose: To combine accelerometer and GPS data to quantify moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on the walk to and from school in relation to overall daily levels. Methods: Participants were 141 children aged 11-12 years from the PEACH Project (Personal and Environmental Associated with Children's Health) in Bristol, England, measured between 2008 and 2009. Eighty-four children met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Accelerometers measured physical activity, GPS receivers recorded location, and mode of travel was self-reported. Data were analyzed between April and October 2011. Combined accelerometer and GPS data were mapped in a GIS. Minutes of MVPA were compared for school journeys taking place between 8:00am and 9:00am and between 3:00pm and 5:00pm and in relation to whole-day levels. Results: Physical activity levels during journeys to and from school were highly similar, and contributed 22.2 minutes (33.7{\%}) of total daily MVPA. In addition, MVPA on the journey did not differ between boys and girls, but because girls have lower levels of daily physical activity than boys, the journey contributed a greater proportion of their daily MVPA (35.6{\%} vs 31.3{\%}). Conclusions: The journey to and from school is a significant contributor to MVPA in children aged 11-12 years. Combining GPS and accelerometer data within a GIS is a useful approach to quantifying specific journeys. ?? 2012 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

Through this study we provide an empirical investigation into the durations and distances that respondents are willing to travel in order to engage in various sports and recreation activities. This research uses time-diary data, augmented with global positioning system information, to investigate individually based and objectively measured travel thresholds (which define travelsheds) for various sports and recreation activities in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Results accord with national time-diary data, and indicate that duration-based and distance-based travelsheds are generally in the order of 15 - 30�minutes and 4 - 20�km, respectively. Georeferenced time-diary data provide unique insights into travel thresholds, which may be used to help improve accessibility and thereby increase the frequency and duration of physical activity engagement.

abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the relationship between physical qualities and match activity profiles of recreational Australian football players. Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Forty players from three recreational Australian football teams (Division One, Two and Three) underwent a battery of fitness tests (vertical jump, 10 and 40. m sprint, 6. m. ??. 30. m repeated sprint test, Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level Two and 2-km time trial). The activity profiles of competitive match-play were quantified using 10-Hz Global Positioning System units. Results: Division One players possessed greater maximum velocity, Yo-Yo level Two and 2-km time trial performances than Division Two and Three players. In addition, Division One players covered greater relative distance, and relative distances at moderate- and high-intensities during match-play than Division Two and Three players. Division Two players had better 2-km time trial performances than Division Three players. Positive associations (P<. 0.05) were found between 10. m acceleration, maximum velocity, Yo-Yo level Two and 2-km time trial performances and relative distance, and relative distances covered at moderate- and high-intensities during match-play. Moderate relationships were found between vertical jump and relative distance and high-intensity running. Conclusions: Sub-elite Australian football players competing at a higher level exhibit greater physical qualities and match-play activity profiles than lesser-skilled recreational players. Acceleration and maximum velocity, 2-km time trial and Yo-Yo level Two performances discriminate between players of different playing levels, and are related to physical match performance in recreational Australian football. The development of these qualities is likely to contribute to improved match performance in recreational Australian football players.},

Park visits, measured both objectively (GPS) and subjectively (travel diary), were temporally linked to accelerometer-measured PA. Park visits occurred at 1.4 per person-week. Participants who visited parks at least once (n=308) had an adjusted average of 14.3 (95{\%} CI: 8.9, 19.6)min more daily PA than participants who did not visit a park. Even when park-related activity was excluded, park visitors still obtained more minutes of daily PA than non-visitors. Park visitation contributes to a more active lifestyle, but is not solely responsible for it. Parks may best serve to complement broader public health efforts to encourage PA.},

This analysis examined objective measures of the BE around participants’ residence and their utilitarian and recreational walking from two studies, one in the urban Seattle area (n = 464) and the other in nine small U.S. towns (n = 299). After adjusting for sociodemographics, small town residents walked less for utilitarian purposes but more for recreational purposes. These differences were largely explained by differential associations of the BE on walking in the two settings. In Seattle, the number of neighborhood restaurants was positively associated with utilitarian walking, but in small towns, the association was negative. In small towns, perception of slow traffic on nearby streets was positively associated with recreational walking, but not in Seattle. These observations suggest that urban–rural context matters when planning BE interventions to support walking.},

Whilst within-village spatial patterning of diseases exists, and can be important, mapping infected cases in a household-by-household setting is arduous and time consuming. With the development of low-cost GPS-data loggers ({\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} (sic)40) and available GoogleEarth (TM) satellite imagery, we present a field-applicable method based on crowdsourcing for rapid identification of infected cases (intestinal schistosomiasis, malaria and hookworm) by household. A total of 126 mothers with their 247 preschool children from Bukoba village (Mayuge District, Uganda) were examined with half of these mothers given a GPS-data logger to walk home with, returning the unit the same day for data off-loading, after which, households were assigned GPS coordinates. A satellite image of Bukoba was annotated with households denoting the infection status of each mother and child. General prevalence of intestinal schistosomiasis, malaria and hookworm in mothers and children was: 27.2 vs 7.7{\%}, 28.6 vs 87.0{\%} and 60.0 vs 22.3{\%}, respectively.

abstract = {Objectives: To examine the influence of quarter outcome and the margin of the score differential on both the physical activity profile and skill performance of players during professional Australian Football matches. Design: Prospective, longitudinal. Methods: Physical activity profiles were assessed via microtechnology (Global Positioning System and accelerometer) from 40 professional AF players from the same team during 15 Australian Football League games. Skill performance measures (involvement and effectiveness) and player rank scores (Champion Data?? Rank) were provided by a commercial statistical provider. The physical performance variables, skill involvements and individual player performance scores were expressed relative to playing time for each quarter. The influence of the quarter result (i.e. win vs. loss) and score margin (i.e. small: <9 points, moderate: 10-18 points, and large: >19 points) on activity profile and skill involvements and skill efficiency performance of players were examined. Results: Skill involvements (total disposals/min, long kicks/min, marks/min, running bounces/min and player rank/min) were greater in quarters won (all p<0.01). In contrast, the players high speed running distance per minute (>14.5kmh-1, HSR/min), sprints/min and peak speed were higher in losing quarters (all p<0.01). Smaller score margins were associated with increased physical activity (m/min, HSR/min, and body load/min, all p<0.05) and decreased skill efficiency (handball clangers/min and player rank/min, all p<0.05). Conclusions: Professional AF players are likely to have an increased physical activity profile and decreased skill involvement and proficiency when their team is less successful. ?? 2013 Sports Medicine Australia.},

Older adults (N = 279;  mean age = 83 ± 6 years) wore a GPS and accelerometer for 6 days. Participants completed standard health measures. The Personal Activity and Location Measurement System (PALMS) was used to calculate the average daily number of trips, distance, and minutes traveled for pedestrian and vehicle trips from the combined GPS and accelerometer data. Linear mixed effects regression models explored relationships between these transportation variables and physical, psychological and cognitive functioning. Number, distance, and minutes of pedestrian trips were positively associated with physical and psychological functioning but not cognitive functioning. Number of vehicle trips was negatively associated with fear of falls; there were no other associations between the vehicle trip variables and functioning. Vehicle travel did not appear to be related to functioning in older adults in retirement communities except that fear of falling was related to number of vehicle trips. Pedestrian trips had moderate associations with multiple physical and psychological functioning measures, supporting a link between walking and many aspects of health in  older adults.},

The main objective of this study was to implement a quantitative assessment of individual exposure to benzene in urban environments. For this purpose, ExPOSITION model based on a global positioning system (GPS) tracking approach was applied to estimate individual exposure in different microenvironments. The current investigation provides an application example and validation of the modeling approach against personal and biological exposure measurements collected during the measurements campaign. The probabilistic approach using the Johnson system of distributions was implemented to characterize variability of indoor concentrations. The results obtained for daily average individual exposure to benzene corresponded to mean levels of 1.6 and 0.8-2.7 $\mu$g/m(3) in terms of 5th-95th percentiles. Validation of the model results against several personal exposure samples collected for the selected individuals revealed a Pearson's correlation coefficient of .66. This modeling approach explicitly addressed the temporal and spatial variability in the exposure and established a source-receptor relationship.},

abstract = {Objective: The primary aim of this study was to assess if self-reported measures of walking limitation correlate better with a community-based assessment of maximum walking distance (MWD) than they do with laboratory-based tests in patients with intermittent claudication. A secondary aim was to examine the effect of prior objective testing on these correlations. Methods: Thirty-one patients completed three self-report tools (self-reported MWD; Walking Impairment Questionnaire [WIQ]; Estimation of Ambulatory Capacity by History-Questionnaire [EACH-Q]) immediately before and approximately 1 week after a series of objective tests (incremental treadmill walking test, 6-minute walk test, 1-hour global positioning system [GPS] recording of a community walk). We analyzed the feasibility of the self-report tools in terms of number of errors and their correlation (r) with objective measures. Results: The correlations of self-report tests to GPS-MWD (range,.579-.808) were consistently higher than with the treadmill test (range,.310-.584) and 6-minute walk test (range,.414-.613). The WIQ had the highest proportion of errors, both at first and second completion (58{\%} and 42{\%}, respectively), compared with self-reported MWD (23{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively) and the EACH-Q (6.5{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively). Correlations were improved with the second set of self-report tests (range,.310-.595 to .414-.808). Conclusions: The fact that all self-report tools correlated better with a community-based measure of MWD using GPS than with laboratory results confirms that they measure what they aim to: community-based MWD. In addition, prescription of a community walk might help patients to better estimate their walking limitation.Copyright © 2013 by the Society for Vascular Surgery.},

abstract = {Purpose: Determine which PA assessment tools are most closely related to frailty and whether PA is different across levels of frailty. Methods: Fifty community-dwelling Greek older women (63-90 years) participated in this study. PA was measured objectively over 10 h using an accelerometer, a heart rate (HR) monitor, a portable electromyography (EMG) unit, and a global positioning system (GPS) and subjectively using the short version of the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity Questionnaire (MLTAQ). Participants were divided into three tertiles based on level of frailty as calculated from a Frailty Index (FI): low FI group ({\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}0.17 FI); intermediate FI group (0.17-0.38 FI); and high FI group ({\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}0.38 FI). Results: Accelerometer step counts had the strongest correlation with frailty and were different across levels of frailty. The percentage of time engaged in PA was 31 +/- 15{\%} when PA was determined using an accelerometer. Forty-five percent of the variability in the FI was explained by a combination of PA assessment tools including; accelerometer, EMG, GPS, and MLTAQ. The individual contribution of EMG determined activity from the biceps brachii (BB) to the FI prediction was 16{\%}. Accelerometer contributed an additional 10{\%} and time engaged in PA, as assessed with the MLTAQ, added an additional 6{\%} to the prediction of FI score. Conclusions: PA assessment tools, when used in combination, provide important information about the PA accumulation of older women across levels of frailty. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health studies and mHealth applications are increasingly resorting to tracking technologies such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to study the relation between mobility, exposures, and health. GPS tracking generates large sets of geographic data that need to be transformed to be useful for health research. This paper proposes a method to test the performance of activity place detection algorithms, and compares the performance of a novel kernel-based algorithm with a more traditional time-distance cluster detection method. METHODS: A set of 750 artificial GPS tracks containing three stops each were generated, with various levels of noise.. A total of 9,000 tracks were processed to measure the algorithms' capacity to detect stop locations and estimate stop durations, with varying GPS noise and algorithm parameters. RESULTS: The proposed kernel-based algorithm outperformed the traditional algorithm on most criteria associated to activity place detection, and offered a stronger resilience to GPS noise, managing to detect up to 92.3{\%} of actual stops, and estimating stop duration within 5{\%} error margins at all tested noise levels. CONCLUSIONS: Capacity to detect activity locations is an important feature in a context of increasing use of GPS devices in health and place research. While further testing with real-life tracks is recommended, testing algorithms' performance with artificial track sets for which characteristics are controlled is useful. The proposed novel algorithm outperformed the traditional algorithm under these conditions.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To validate a nondifferential global positioning system (GPS) to measure speed, displacement, and position during human locomotion. METHODS: Three healthy participants walked and ran over straight and curved courses for 59 and 34 trials, respectively. A nondifferential GPS receiver provided speed data by Doppler shift and change in GPS position over time, which were compared with actual speeds determined by chronometry. Displacement data from the GPS were compared with a surveyed 100-m section, and static positions were collected for 1 h and compared with the known geodetic point. RESULTS: GPS speed values on the straight course were closely correlated with actual speeds (Doppler shift: r = 0.9994, P < 0.001, Delta GPS position/time: r = 0.9984, P < 0.001). Actual speed errors were lowest using the Doppler shift method (90.8{\%} of values within +/- 0.1 m x s(-1)). Speed was slightly underestimated on a curved path, though still highly correlated with actual speed (Doppler shift: r = 0.9985, P < 0.001, Delta GPS distance/time: r = 0.9973, P < 0.001). Distance measured by GPS was 100.46 +/- 0.49 m, and 86.5{\%} of static points were within 1.5 m of the actual geodetic point (mean error: 1.08 +/- 0.34 m, range 0.69-2.10 m). CONCLUSIONS: Nondifferential GPS demonstrated a highly accurate estimation of speed across a wide range of human locomotion velocities using only the raw signal data with a minimal decrease in accuracy around bends. This high level of resolution was matched by accurate displacement and position data. Coupled with reduced size, cost, and ease of use, this method offers a valid alternative to differential GPS in the study of overground locomotion.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate speed regulation during overground running on undulating terrain. METHODS: After an initial laboratory session to calculate physiological thresholds, eight experienced runners completed a spontaneously paced time trial over three laps of an outdoor course involving uphill, downhill, and level sections. A portable gas analyzer, global positioning system receiver, and activity monitor were used to collect physiological, speed, and stride frequency data. RESULTS: Participants ran 23{\%} slower on uphills and 13.8{\%} faster on downhills compared with level sections. Speeds on level sections were significantly different for 78.4 +/- 7.0 s following an uphill and 23.6 +/- 2.2 s following a downhill. Speed changes were primarily regulated by stride length, which was 20.5{\%} shorter uphill and 16.2{\%} longer downhill, whereas stride frequency was relatively stable. Oxygen consumption averaged 100.4{\%} of runner's individual ventilatory thresholds on uphills, 78.9{\%} on downhills, and 89.3{\%} on level sections. Approximately 89{\%} of group-level speed was predicted using a modified gradient factor. Individuals adopted distinct pacing strategies, both across laps and as a function of gradient. CONCLUSIONS: Speed was best predicted using a weighted factor to account for prior and current gradients. Oxygen consumption (VO2) limited runner's speeds only on uphill sections and was maintained in line with individual ventilatory thresholds. Running speed showed larger individual variation on downhill sections, whereas speed on the level was systematically influenced by the preceding gradient. Runners who varied their pace more as a function of gradient showed a more consistent level of oxygen consumption. These results suggest that optimizing time on the level sections after hills offers the greatest potential to minimize overall time when running over undulating terrain.},

abstract = {Purpose: The primary aim of this pilot study was to assess how well the combination of global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometer data predicted different activity modes. Methods: Ten adults (seven male, three female; 23-51 yr) simultaneously wore a GPS unit and accelerometer during bouts of walking, jogging/running, bicycling, inline skating, or driving an automobile. Discriminant function analysis was used to identify a parsimonious combination of variables derived from accelerometer counts and steps and GPS speed that best classified mode. A total of 29 bouts were used to develop this classification criterion. This criterion was validated using two datasets generated from the complete collection of minute-by-minute values from all bouts. Results: Model development with "calibration" data showed that two accelerometer variables alone (median counts and steps) resulted in 26 of 29 bouts (90{\%}) being correctly classified. Prediction of activity mode using counts and steps in a minute-by-minute "validation" dataset (N = 200) was 86.5{\%}. Using three variables from the accelerometer and GPS (median counts, steps and speed) resulted in correct classification in 27 of 29 activity bouts in the "calibration" data (93{\%}). In the "validation" dataset comprising 200 min, the combination of accelerometer counts and steps and GPS speed were able to correctly classify 91{\%} of the observations. Walking and bicycling minutes were correctly classified most frequently (96{\%}). In another "validation" dataset consisting of activity bouts, this combination of variables resulted in correct classification in 42 of 43 bouts (98{\%}). Conclusion: This pilot study provides evidence that the addition of GPS to accelerometer monitoring improves physical activity mode classification to a small degree. Larger studies among free-living individuals and with an expanded range of activities are needed to replicate the current findings and further determine the merits of using GPS with accelerometers for mode identification. © 2008 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

Applications such as location-based services and quantified self harness such data to bring meaningful context to users' behavior. As social applications are becoming prevalent, there is a trend for users to share their mobile data the nature of online social networking poses new challenges for controlling access to private data, as compared to traditional enterprise systems. First, the user may have a large number of friends, each associated with a unique access policy. Second, the access control policies must be dynamic and fine-grained, i.e they are content-based, as opposed to all-or-nothing. In this paper, we investigate the challenges in sharing of mobile data in social applications. We design and evaluate a middleware running on Google App Engine, named Mosco, that manages and facilitates sharing of mobile data in a privacy-preserving manner. We use Mosco to develop a location sharing and a health monitoring application. Mosco helps shorten the development process. Finally, we perform benchmarking experiments with Mosco, the results of which indicate small overhead and high scalability. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As an indicator of physical and cognitive functioning in community-dwelling older adults, there is increasing interest in measuring life space, defined as the geographical area a person covers in daily life. Typically measured through questionnaires, life space can be challenging to assess in amnestic dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). While global positioning system (GPS) technology has been suggested as a potential solution, there remains a lack of data validating GPS-based methods to measure life space in cognitively impaired populations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the construct validity of a GPS system to provide quantitative measurements of global movement for individuals with mild-to-moderate AD. METHODS: Nineteen community-dwelling older adults with mild-to-moderate AD (Mini-Mental State Examination score 14-28, age 70.7 ± 2.2 years) and 33 controls (CTL; age 74.0 ± 1.2 years) wore a GPS-enabled mobile phone during the day for 3 days. Measures of geographical territory (area, perimeter, mean distance from home, and time away from home) were calculated from the GPS log. Following a log-transformation to produce symmetrical distributions, group differences were tested using two-sample t tests. Construct validity of the GPS measures was tested by examining the correlation between the GPS measures and indicators of physical function [steps/day, gait velocity, and Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD)] and affective state (Apathy Evaluation Scale and Geriatric Depression Scale). Multivariate regression was performed to evaluate the relative strength of significantly correlated factors. RESULTS: GPS-derived area (p < 0.01), perimeter (p < 0.01), and mean distance from home (p < 0.05) were smaller in the AD group compared to CTL. The correlation analysis found significant associations of the GPS measures area and perimeter with all measures of physical function (steps/day, DAD, and gait velocity; p < 0.01), symptoms of apathy (p < 0.01), and depression (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that gait velocity and dependence were the strongest variables associated with GPS measures. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that GPS-derived area and perimeter: (1) distinguished mild-to-moderate AD patients from CTL and (2) were strongly correlated with physical function and affective state. These findings confirm the ability of GPS technology to assess life space behaviour and may be particularly valuable to continuously monitor functional decline associated with neurodegenerative disease, such as AD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of 2 interventions in improving the physical activity and well-being of secondary school children., DESIGN: A clustered randomised controlled trial; classes, 1 per school, were assigned to 1 of 3 intervention arms or a control group based on a 2x2 factorial design. The interventions were peer-mentoring and participative learning. Year 7 children (aged 11-12) in the peer-mentoring intervention were paired with year 9 children for 6 weekly mentoring meetings. Year 7 children in the participative learning arm took part in 6 weekly geography lessons using personalised physical activity and Global Positioning System (GPS) data. Year 7 children in the combined intervention received both interventions, with the year 9 children only participating in the mentoring sessions., PARTICIPANTS: 1494 year 7 students from 60 schools in the North of England took part in the trial. Of these, 43 students opted out of taking part in the evaluation measurements, 2 moved teaching group and 58 changed school. Valid accelerometry outcome data were collected for 892 students from 53 schools; and well-being outcome data were available for 927 students from 52 schools., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were mean minutes of accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity per day, and well-being as evaluated by the KIDSCREEN-27 questionnaire. These data were collected 6 weeks after the intervention; a 12-month follow-up is planned., RESULTS: No significant effects (main or interaction) were observed for the outcomes. However, small positive differences were found for both outcomes for the participative learning intervention., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the 2 school-based interventions did not modify levels of physical activity or well-being within the period monitored. Change in physical activity may require more comprehensive individual behavioural intervention, and/or more system-based efforts to address wider environmental influences such as family, peers, physical environment, transport and educational policy., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN82956355.Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

abstract = {Empiric quantification of human mobility patterns is paramount for better urban planning, understanding social network structure and responding to infectious disease threats, especially in light of rapid growth in urbanization and globalization. This need is of particular relevance for developing countries, since they host the majority of the global urban population and are disproportionally affected by the burden of disease. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) data-loggers to track the fine-scale (within city) mobility patterns of 582 residents from two neighborhoods from the city of Iquitos, Peru. We used ∼2.3 million GPS data-points to quantify age-specific mobility parameters and dynamic co-location networks among all tracked individuals. Geographic space significantly affected human mobility, giving rise to highly local mobility kernels. Most (∼80{\%}) movements occurred within 1 km of an individual's home. Potential hourly contacts among individuals were highly irregular and temporally unstructured. Only up to 38{\%} of the tracked participants showed a regular and predictable mobility routine, a sharp contrast to the situation in the developed world. As a case study, we quantified the impact of spatially and temporally unstructured routines on the dynamics of transmission of an influenza-like pathogen within an Iquitos neighborhood. Temporally unstructured daily routines (e.g., not dominated by a single location, such as a workplace, where an individual repeatedly spent significant amount of time) increased an epidemic's final size and effective reproduction number by 20{\%} in comparison to scenarios modeling temporally structured contacts. Our findings provide a mechanistic description of the basic rules that shape human mobility within a resource-poor urban center, and contribute to the understanding of the role of fine-scale patterns of individual movement and co-location in infectious disease dynamics. More generally, this study emphasizes the need for careful consideration of human social interactions when designing infectious disease mitigation strategies, particularly within resource-poor urban environments.},

abstract = {Background: Our understanding of the effects of human movement on dengue virus spread remains limited in part due to the lack of precise tools to monitor the time-dependent location of individuals. We determined the utility of a new, commercially available, GPS data-logger for long-term tracking of human movements in Iquitos, Peru. We conducted a series of evaluations focused on GPS device attributes key to reliable use and accuracy. GPS observations from two participants were later compared with semi-structured interview data to assess the usefulness of GPS technology to track individual mobility patterns. Results: Positional point and line accuracy were 4.4 and 10.3 m, respectively. GPS wearing mode increased spatial point error by 6.9 m. Units were worn on a neck-strap by a carpenter and a moto-taxi driver for 14-16 days. The application of a clustering algorithm (I-cluster) to the raw GPS positional data allowed the identification of locations visited by each participant together with the frequency and duration of each visit. The carpenter moved less and spent more time in more fixed locations than the moto-taxi driver, who visited more locations for a shorter period of time. GPS and participants' interviews concordantly identified 6 common locations, whereas GPS alone identified 4 locations and participants alone identified 10 locations. Most (80{\%}) of the locations identified by participants alone were places reported as visited for less than 30 minutes. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel, commercially available GPS data-logger for long-term tracking of humans and shows the potential of these units to quantify mobility patterns in relationship with dengue virus transmission risk in a tropical urban environment. Cost, battery life, size, programmability and ease of wear are unprecedented from previously tested units, proving the usefulness of GPS-dataloggers for linking movement of individuals and transmission risk of dengue virus and other infectious agents, particularly in resource-poor settings.},

abstract = {Walking as an out-of-home mobility activity is recognised for its contribution to healthy and active ageing. The environment can have a powerful effect on the amount of walking activity undertaken by older people, thereby influencing their capacity to maintain their well-being and independence. This paper reports the findings from research examining the experiences of neighbourhood walking for 12 older people from six different inner-city high density suburbs, through analysis of data derived from travel diaries, individual time/space activity maps (created via global positioning systems (GPS) tracking over a seven-day period and geographic information system (GIS) technology), and in-depth interviews. Reliance on motor vehicles, the competing interests of pedestrians and cyclists on shared pathways and problems associated with transit systems, public transport, and pedestrian infrastructure emerged as key barriers to older people venturing out of home on foot. GPS and GIS technology provide new opportunities for furthering understanding of the out-of-home mobility of older populations. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

abstract = {This study investigated whether pacing differed between 68 male and 35 female triathletes competing over the same ITU World Cup course. Swimming, cycling and running velocities (m s-1 and km h-1) were measured using a global positioning system (Garmin, UK), video analysis (Panasonic NV-MX300EG), and timing system (Datasport, Switzerland). The relationship between performance in each discipline and finishing position was determined. Speed over the first 222 m of the swim was associated with position (r = -0.88 in males, r = -0.97 in females, both p < 0.01) and offset from the leader, at the swim finish (r = -0.42 in males, r = -0.49 in females, both p < 0.01). The latter affected which pack number was attained in bike lap 1 (r = 0.81 in males, r = 0.93 in females, both p < 0.01), bike finishing position (both r = 0.41, p < 0.01) and overall finishing position (r = 0.39 in males, r = 0.47 in females, both p < 0.01). Average biking speed, and both speed and pack attained in bike laps 1 and 2, influenced finishing position less in the males (r = -0.42, -0.2 and -0.42, respectively, versus r = -0.74, -0.75, and -0.72, respectively, in the females, all p < 0.01). Average run speed correlated better with finishing position in males (r = -0.94, p < 0.01) than females (r = -0.71, p < 0.001). Both sexes ran faster over the first 993 m than most other run sections but no clear benefit of this strategy was apparent. The extent to which the results reflect sex differences in field size and relative ability in each discipline remains unclear. © 2007 Sports Medicine Australia.},

abstract = {Background: Active travel to school is a potential source of physical activity for adolescents, but its assessments often rely on assumptions around travel patterns. Global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometry provide an objective assessment of physical activity from school-travel and the context in which it occurs (where, when, how long). Purpose: To describe school-travel patterns of adolescents and to compare estimates of physical activity during the hour before/after school - a commonly used proxy for school-travel time - with physical activity accrued during school trips identified through GPS ('GPS-trips'). Methods: Adolescents (. n=49, 13.3??0.7 years, 37{\%} female) from Downtown Vancouver wore an accelerometer (GT3X+) and GPS (Qstarz) for 7 days (October 2012). Minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during the hour before/after school and during GPS-trips were calculated for the n=130 school-trips made by 43 students. We used multilevel linear regression to assess the association between MVPA during GPS-trips and MVPA during the hour/before school. Results: Only 55{\%} of school-trips were from/to home and within the hour before/after school ('normal'). Estimates of MVPA during the hour before/after school were higher than during GPS-trips (12.0 vs. 8.0. min). On average, MVPA during GPS-trips was linearly associated with MVPA during the hour before/after school, suggesting that physical activity levels during the hour before/after school are broadly reflective of physical activity from school-travel. Conclusion: GPS and accelerometry provide context-rich information relating to school-travel. The hour before/after school may - on average - provide a simple means to crudely estimate physical activity from school-travel when GPS are not available.},

abstract = {Background: Walking and cycling to school is a source of physical activity (PA). Little is known about public transit use for travel to school and whether it is a physically active alternative to car use for those who live too far to walk. Purpose: To describe school-trip characteristics, including PA, across travel modes and to assess the association between PA with walk distance. Methods: High school students (13.3. ??. 0.7. years, 37{\%} female) from Downtown Vancouver wore accelerometers (GT3X. +) and global positioning systems (GPS) (QStarz BT-Q1000XT) for 7. days in October 2012. We included students with valid school-trip data (. n=. 100 trips made by n=. 42 students). We manually identified school-trips and mode from GPS and calculated trip duration, distance, speed, and trip-based moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA; min). We assessed between-mode differences and associations using multilevel regression analyses (spring 2014). Results: Students accrued 9.1. min (??. 5.1) of trip-based MVPA, which was no different between walk and transit trips (. p=. 0.961). Walking portions of transit trips were similar to walking trips in terms of distance (. p=. 0.265) and duration (. p=. 0.493). Walk distance was associated with MVPA in a dose-response manner. Conclusions: Public transit use can contribute meaningfully toward daily PA. Thus, school policies that promote active school-travel should consider including public transit.},

abstract = {Problems posed by the environmental impact of transport are serious, growing and constitute a major challenge to policy makers at all levels. The current array of technological, institutional and planning tools available to deal with these problems are inadequate and need urgently to be upgraded. A key feature of these problems is that they arise from the interaction of human behavioural systems and physical systems. Thus, to improve our understanding of environmental and health problems associated with vehicle emissions, it is necessary to combine data on both travel and traffic behaviour with environmental data. This requires simultaneous data on travel, traffic and environmental variables. There are currently no such integrated databases available in the United Kingdom, and the inability to collect self-consistent traffic, travel and environmental data is a major impediment to the development of the necessary scientific underpinning for effective policy interventions. This paper presents a high level description of a real-time global positioning system based vehicle performance and emissions monitoring system currently under development in the UK, to contribute to the realisation of the data requirements highlighted above.},

This pilot research project evaluated the whole body accelerations and cardiovascular challenge provided by selected walks in the Canberra region of Australia to determine if walks could be ranked according to potential level of impact on both cardiovascular fitness and bone health. Nine participants, who described themselves as walking at least 3{\^{A}} km, three times per week, wore a data logging device recording heart rate, acceleration and GPS position while walking three outdoor tracks: (1) the running track of an athletics stadium; (2) on a hill climb path through bushland; and (3) on a route through suburban streets. There was a significant difference (P{\^{A}} <{\^{A}} 0.05) for heart rate, distribution of whole body accelerations and average walking speed between track 2 and tracks 1 and 3. There was a significant difference for heart rate, distribution of whole body accelerations and average walking speed between the walks. The running track and the suburban walk provide a moderate exercise challenge, with the hill climb walk providing progressively greater vertical height challenge, resulting in an increased cardiovascular exercise challenge. No participant effectively exceeded the threshold for achieving a positive impact on bone density (100 or more accelerations/day >3.6{\^{A}} g) on track 1, and only two of the nine participants intermittently achieved this threshold on tracks 2 and 3.},

Findings at the zero-order and latent variable levels confirmed that cognitive resources were more closely linked with out-of-home behavior than motivational resources.

The RLMSP-i comprised low- to moderate-intensity running, interspersed by high-intensity sprinting and tackling activity, based on global positioning system (GPS) data recorded during Super League performances. Results: The lowest coefficient of variation (CV +/- 95{\%} CI) was observed for total m/min during both interchange bout 1 (1.1{\%} +/- 0.2{\%}) and bout 2 (1.0{\%} +/- 0.2{\%}). The percentage of heart rate peak and ratings of perceived exertion demonstrated CVs of 1.2-2.0{\%} and 2.9-3.5{\%}, respectively. The poorest agreement between trials was found for blood lactate concentration (16.2{\%} +/- 2.8{\%}). In no case was the CV smaller than the smallest worthwhile change, yet in every case the moderate changes were larger than the CV. Conclusions: The RLMSP-i's reliability is sufficient to enable the detection of moderate changes in various performance and physiological measurements that accurately simulate some, but not all, aspects of rugby league matches.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND$\backslash$nThigmotaxis refers to a specific behavior of animals, i.e. to stay close to walls when exploring an open space. Such behavior can be assessed with the open field test (OFT), which is a well-established indicator of animal fear. The detection of similar open field behavior in humans may verify the translational validity of this paradigm. Enhanced thigmotaxis related to anxiety may suggest the relevance of such behavior for anxiety disorders, especially agoraphobia. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS$\backslash$nGlobal positioning system (GPS) was used to analyze the behavior of 16 agoraphobic patients and 18 healthy individuals who have a risk for agoraphobia, i.e. high anxiety sensitivity, during a human OFT and compare it with the appropriate control groups (n=16; n=19). We also tracked 17 agoraphobic patients and 17 controls participants during a city walk, which involved walking through an open market square. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS$\backslash$nOur human OFT triggered thigmotaxis in participants, and agoraphobic patients as well as high anxiety sensitivity participants exhibited enhanced thigmotaxis. This was evident in increased movement lengths along the natural open field’s wall and fewer entries into the field’s center in spite of normal movement speed and length. Furthermore, participants avoided the market square during the city walk, indicating again that thigmotaxis is related to agoraphobia. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS$\backslash$nThis study is the first to verify the translational validity of the OFT and to reveal that thigmotaxis, an evolutionarily adaptive behavior shown by most species, is related to agoraphobia, a pathological fear of open spaces, and anxiety sensitivity, a risk factor for agoraphobia.},

Although global positioning system (GPS)-enabled smartphones can collect life-space data passively and accurately, researchers lack an effective process to derive activity information from the raw GPS data. In addition, the influence of GPS retrieving frequency on life-space characterization is unknown. We describe a GPS data processing procedure to estimate life-space. A cellular telephone was used to collect GPS data by a subject during a 4-month period. The GPS data processing procedure was then implemented and evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity to observation frequency. The proposed scheme generated sufficient zone-based activity information to characterize an individual’s life-space. The speed-based sensitivity assessment suggests 75s as an appropriate GPS observation interval for smartphone based life-space data collection.},

abstract = {Life-space is a promising method for estimating older adults' functional status. However, traditional life-space measures are costly and time consuming because they often rely on active subject participation. This study assesses the feasibility of using the global positioning system (GPS) function of smart phones to generate life-space indicators. We first evaluated the location accuracy of smart-phone-collected GPS points versus those acquired by a commercial GPS unit. We then assessed the specificity of the smart-phone-processed life-space information against the traditional diary method. Our results suggested comparable location accuracy between the smart phone and the standard GPS unit in most outdoor situations. In addition, the smart-phone method revealed more comprehensive life-space information than the diary method, which leads to higher and more consistent life-space scores. We conclude that the smart-phone method is more reliable than traditional methods for measuring life-space. Further improvements will be required to develop a robust application of this method that is suitable for health-related practices.

Although out-of-home mobility is important for the well-being of older people with cognitive impairment, its importance for their caregivers is not clear. This study aims to clarify the relationship between caregiving burden and out-of-home mobility of care-recipients using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) technology. Methods: Seventy-six dyads (care-recipients and caregivers) were recruited from a psychogeriatric center, where they underwent cognitive assessment, followed by psychosocial interviews at home. Care-recipients received GPS tracking kits to carry for a period of four weeks, whenever they left home. Mobility data and diagnostic and psychosocial data were examined in relation to caregiver burden. Results: The strongest predictors of burden were care-recipients' lower cognitive status and more time spent walking out-of-home. An interaction was found between cognitive status and time spent walking in relation to caregiver burden. The relationship between walking and burden was stronger among caregivers of care-recipients with dementia than caregivers of care-recipients with no cognitive impairment or mild cognitive impairment. Care-recipients' behavioral and emotional states were also positively related to caregiver burden. Conclusions: The findings stress the importance of maintaining older persons' out-of-home mobility during cognitive decline.},

abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the application of differential ratings of perceived exertion for the examination of internal load during Australian Football League (AFL) matches. Design: Single cohort, observational study. Methods: Using the centiMax rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale, 26 professional AFL players provided ratings for match exertion (RPE-M), along with differential ratings for breathlessness (RPE-B), leg exertion (RPE-L), and technical demand (RPE-T) following 129 matches (5.0 ?? 1.6 matches per player). Global positioning satellite (GPS) and accelerometer measures were also collected. Data were analysed using magnitude-based inferences. Results: RPE scores were 93.0 ?? 8.2 AU (RPE-M), 89.0 ?? 11.0 AU (RPE-B), 91.5 ?? 9.8 AU (RPE-L), and 87.0 ?? 10.0 AU (RPE-T). There was a most likely small difference between RPE-L and RPE-T (5.5{\%}; ??90{\%} confidence limits 1.9{\%}), a likely small difference between RPE-L and RPE-B (3.5{\%}; ??1.5{\%}) and a possibly small difference between RPE-B and RPE-T (1.9{\%}; ??1.9{\%}). Within-player correlations between RPE and GPS measures were small for RPE-M (r= 0.14-0.28), unclear to small for RPE-B (r= 0.06-0.24) and unclear to moderate for RPE-L (r= 0.06-0.37). Differential RPE's combined to explain 76{\%} of the variance in RPE-M. For all RPE scores, within-player variability was moderate to high (typical error: 7.9-12.4{\%}), and the thresholds for a likely between-match change were 8.8-13.7{\%}. Conclusions: As differential RPE's represent distinct sensory inputs, the collection of these scores facilitate the interpretation of internal match loads and therefore represent a valuable addition to match data collection procedures. Moderate to high within-player variability should be considered when interpreting between-match changes in all RPE scores.},

abstract = {Studies on the relationship between behavioral competence, such as the competence of exerting out-of-home behavior (OOHB), and well-being in older adults have rarely addressed cognitive status as a potentially moderating factor. We included 35 persons with early-stage dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), 76 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 146 cognitively healthy (CH) study participants (grand mean age: M = 72.9 years; SD = 6.4 years). OOHB indicators were assessed based on a multi-method assessment strategy, using both GPS (global positioning system) tracking technology and structured self-reports. Environmental mastery and positive as well as negative affect served as wellbeing indicators and were assessed by established questionnaires. Three theoretically postulated OOHB dimensions of different complexity (out-of-home walking behavior, global out-of-home mobility, and out-of-home activities) were supported by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We also found in the DAT group that environmental mastery was substantially and positively related to less complex out-of-home walking behavior, which was not the case in MCI and CH individuals. In contrast, more complex out-of-home activities were associated with higher negative affect in the DAT as well as the MCI group, but not in CH persons. These findings point to the possibility that relationships between OOHB and well-being depend on the congruence between available cognitive resources and the complexity of the OOHB dimension considered.

abstract = {Previous studies on predictors of out-of-home behavior (OOHB) have often neglected the multidimensional nature of this construct. The present study distinguished between two levels of analyzing OOHB: out-of-home mobility seen as single behavioral units (e.g., number of places visited, action range, and walking) versus OOHBs seen as engagement in integrated, larger activity units (e.g., cognitively and physically demanding activities). We examined whether a differential relationship between these levels of OOHBs with established predictors of OOHBs, i.e., socio-demographic variables, cognitive abilities, physical functioning, and depression, exists. A sample of 100 cognitively healthy, community-dwelling adults with a mean age of 70.8 years underwent a multi-method OOHB assessment using GPS- (out-of-home mobility) and questionnaire-based (out-of-home activity engagement) measures. Predictors were assessed based on internationally implemented procedures. Regression analyses showed that walking-based mobility and engagement in physical activities could be predicted by physical functioning, whereas most effects of socio-demographic variables, such as age and gender, and of depression on OOHBs were negligible. At the bivariate level, episodic memory was related to action range, global mobility, and to cognitively demanding activity engagement, but not to walking, whereas executive function was related with physically demanding activity engagement only. However, some of these connections became weaker in the full predictor model. Findings support the notion that it is necessary to assess OOHB as a multiple-indicator construct.},

Methods: A total of 27 chronic stroke patients, discharged to their own homes, were tested twice, within 5 consecutive days. The 6MWT was conducted using a GPS and an measuring wheel simultaneously to determine walking distance. Reproducibility was determined as test-retest reliability and agreement, using the intraclass correlation coefficient, standard error of measurement and Bland {\&} Altman plots. Responsiveness was expressed as the smallest real difference and visualized in Bland {\&} Altman plots. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was used to study concurrent validity between the GPS and measuring wheel. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficiens were 0.96 for the GPS and 0.98 for the measuring wheel, and standard error of measurement scores were 11.9 m for the measuring wheel and 18.1 m for the GPS, resulting in smallest real differences of 33.0 m and 50.2 m, respectively. Concurrent validity was strong (r=0.99). Conclusion: These results indicate that the outdoor 6MWT using a GPS or measuring wheel is reproducible, responsive and concurrently valid. This suggests that therapists working in the community can use the outdoor 6MWT as a reliable, responsive and valid test.},

Methods: Data were collected between 2006 and 2008 from 1,307 children aged 10-11 in Bristol, UK. Accelerometers and Global Positioning System receivers measured activity and location every 10. s (epoch) after school for four days. Data were mapped in a Geographic Information System with a greenspace dataset. Activity volume (accelerometer counts per minute), time in moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and the odds of an epoch being MVPA (using logistic regression) were compared for greenspace, non-greenspace and indoors. Results: 13{\%} of monitored time was spent outdoors (2{\%} in greenspace), during which time 30{\%} of activity volume and 35{\%} of MVPA was accumulated. 7{\%} of boys' activity volume and 9{\%} of MVPA were in greenspace with girls slightly lower (5{\%} and 6{\%} respectively). The odds of an epoch being MVPA in greenspace relative to outdoor non-greenspace was 1.37 (95{\%} CI 1.22-1.53) for boys and 1.08 (95{\%} CI 0.95-1.22) for girls. Conclusion: Most activity occurring outdoors is not in greenspace and non-green urban environments are therefore very important for children's activity. However, when boys are in greenspace, activity is more likely to be of higher intensity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Therefore, in the present study we investigated the influence of bladder filling, if any, on wall properties of the common femoral artery. The results obtained were compared with those obtained in the common carotid artery. The study was performed on the right common carotid and right common femoral arteries of normotensive young (18-35 y) female volunteers (n = 24). Using a specially designed ultrasonic wall-tracking device and automatic brachial artery cuff blood pressure measurements, arterial distension (absolute change in diameter during the cardiac cycle; Delta D), strain (Delta D/D), and cross-sectional distensibility (DC) and compliance (CC) mere determined before and after voiding. Distension and strain of the common femoral artery were significantly lower for a full than for an empty bladder. DC and CC were lower when the bladder was filled, but these differences did not reach the level of significance. Blood pressure as measured at the level of the brachial artery and heart rate were not statistically significantly different during a full or an empty bladder. It is concluded that bladder filling affects femoral artery wall properties, an observation that should be kept in mind when performing studies on artery wall properties at this level of the circulation.

abstract = {Global positioning system (GPS) monitoring of movement patterns is widespread in elite football including the Australian Football League (AFL). However documented analysis of this activity is lacking. We quantified the movement patterns of AFL football and differences between nomadic (midfield), forward and defender playing positions, and determined whether the physical demands have increased over a four season period. Selected premiership games were monitored during the 2005 (n=80 game files), 2006 (n=244), 2007 (n=632) and 2008 (n=793) AFL seasons. Players were fitted with a shoulder harness containing a GPS unit. GPS data were downloaded after games and the following measures extracted: total distance (km), time in various speed zones, maximum speed, number of surges, accelerations, longest continuous efforts and a derived exertion index representing playing intensity. In 2008 nomadic players covered per game 3.4{\%} more total distance (km), had 4.8{\%} less playing time (min), a 17{\%} higher exertion index (per min), and 23{\%} more time running >18kmh-1 than forwards and defenders (all p<0.05). Physical demands were substantially higher in the 2008 season compared with 2005: an 8.4{\%} increase in mean speed, a 14{\%} increase in intensity (exertion index) and a 9.0{\%} decrease in playing time (all p<0.05). Nomadic players in AFL work substantially harder than forwards and defenders in covering more ground and at higher running intensities. Increases in the physical demands of AFL football were evident between 2005 and 2008. The increasing speed of the game has implications for game authorities, players and coaching staff. © 2009 Sports Medicine Australia.},

abstract = {As our populations become more urbanised, public green space will assume key functions in the promotion of the health and well-being of the populace. We assessed the beneficial outcomes of physical activities undertaken in Australian national parks using a questionnaire-based survey combined with GPS tracking of walkers, hikers, and runners. We estimated energy expenditure of park visitors based on GPS tracking trip data using two different estimation methods. Park visitors perceived considerable improvement in numerous health and well-being indicators; many of which increased with increasing activity levels. We found that hikers burned the greatest amount of net energy (916 kcal) as they preferred more difficult tracks with greater slopes, followed by runners (790 kcal) and walkers (450 kcal). For many walkers and hikers, physical activity was incidental to other activities such as sightseeing, socialising, and experiencing nature; such activities, thus, deserve highlighting when promoting attributes of parks and other public green spaces. GPS tracking allowed for sampling a broad population of park visitors at a participation rate of 80{\%}, and the calculation of additional trip characteristics such as trip distance and velocity. Identifying health and well-being benefits via an inter-disciplinary approach using GPS tracking data to determine the intensity and spatio-temporal distributions of physical activity in relation to different park infrastructure is a promising area for attention to raise awareness of the direct benefits of visiting public green spaces. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite its efficacy and cost-effectiveness, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is undertaken by less than one-third of clinically eligible cardiac patients in every country for which data is available. Reasons for non-participation include the unavailability of hospital-based rehabilitation programs, or excessive travel time and distance. For this reason, there have been calls for the development of more flexible alternatives.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a system to enable walking-based cardiac rehabilitation in which the patient's single-lead ECG, heart rate, GPS-based speed and location are transmitted by a programmed smartphone to a secure server for real-time monitoring by a qualified exercise scientist. The feasibility of this approach was evaluated in 134 remotely-monitored exercise assessment and exercise sessions in cardiac patients unable to undertake hospital-based rehabilitation. Completion rates, rates of technical problems, detection of ECG changes, pre- and post-intervention six minute walk test (6 MWT), cardiac depression and Quality of Life (QOL) were key measures. The system was rated as easy and quick to use. It allowed participants to complete six weeks of exercise-based rehabilitation near their homes, worksites, or when travelling. The majority of sessions were completed without any technical problems, although periodic signal loss in areas of poor coverage was an occasional limitation. Several exercise and post-exercise ECG changes were detected. Participants showed improvements comparable to those reported for hospital-based programs, walking significantly further on the post-intervention 6 MWT, 637 m (95{\%} CI: 565-726), than on the pre-test, 524 m (95{\%} CI: 420-655), and reporting significantly reduced levels of cardiac depression and significantly improved physical health-related QOL.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The system provided a feasible and very flexible alternative form of supervised cardiac rehabilitation for those unable to access hospital-based programs, with the potential to address a well-recognised deficiency in health care provision in many countries. Future research should assess its longer-term efficacy, cost-effectiveness and safety in larger samples representing the spectrum of cardiac morbidity and severity.},

abstract = {Exposure to traffic-related pollutants is associated with both morbidity and mortality. Because vehicle-exhaust are highly localized, within a few hundred meters of heavily traveled roadways, highly accurate spatial data are critical in studies concerned with exposure to vehicle emissions. We compared the positional accuracy of a widely used U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) roadway network containing traffic activity data versus a global positioning system (GPS)-validated road network without traffic information; developed a geographical information system (GIS)-based methodology for producing improved roadway data associated with traffic activities; evaluated errors from geocoding processes; and used the CALINE4 dispersion model to demonstrate potential exposure misclassifications due to inaccurate roadway data or incorrectly geocoded addresses. The GIS-based algorithm we developed was effective in transferring vehicle activity information from the less accurate USGS roadway network to a GPS-accurate road network, with a match rate exceeding 95{\%}. Large discrepancies, up to hundreds of meters, were found between the two roadway networks, with the GPS-validated network having higher spatial accuracy. In addition, identifying and correcting errors associated with geocoding resulted in improved address matching. We demonstrated that discrepancies in roadway geometry and geocoding errors, can lead to serious exposure misclassifications, up to an order of magnitude in assigned pollutant concentrations. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.},

abstract = {Background: Air pollution epidemiological studies are increasingly using global positioning system (GPS) to collect time-location data because they offer continuous tracking, high temporal resolution, and minimum reporting burden for participants. However, substantial uncertainties in the processing and classifying of raw GPS data create challenges for reliably characterizing time activity patterns. We developed and evaluated models to classify people's major time activity patterns from continuous GPS tracking data. Methods: We developed and evaluated two automated models to classify major time activity patterns (i.e., indoor, outdoor static, outdoor walking, and in-vehicle travel) based on GPS time activity data collected under free living conditions for 47 participants (N = 131 person-days) from the Harbor Communities Time Location Study (HCTLS) in 2008 and supplemental GPS data collected from three UC-Irvine research staff (N = 21 person-days) in 2010. Time activity patterns used for model development were manually classified by research staff using information from participant GPS recordings, activity logs, and follow-up interviews. We evaluated two models: (a) a rule-based model that developed user-defined rules based on time, speed, and spatial location, and (b) a random forest decision tree model. Results: Indoor, outdoor static, outdoor walking and in-vehicle travel activities accounted for 82.7{\%}, 6.1{\%}, 3.2{\%} and 7.2{\%} of manually-classified time activities in the HCTLS dataset, respectively. The rule-based model classified indoor and in-vehicle travel periods reasonably well (Indoor: sensitivity {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} 91{\%}, specificity {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} 80{\%}, and precision {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} 96{\%}; in-vehicle travel: sensitivity {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} 71{\%}, specificity {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} 99{\%}, and precision {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} 88{\%}), but the performance was moderate for outdoor static and outdoor walking predictions. No striking differences in performance were observed between the rule-based and the random forest models. The random forest model was fast and easy to execute, but was likely less robust than the rule-based model under the condition of biased or poor quality training data. Conclusions: Our models can successfully identify indoor and in-vehicle travel points from the raw GPS data, but challenges remain in developing models to distinguish outdoor static points and walking. Accurate training data are essential in developing reliable models in classifying time-activity patterns.},

Exposures to traffic-related air pollutants are strongly influenced by time spent near traffic. However, little is known about women's travel activities during pregnancy and whether questionnaire-based data can provide reliable information on travel patterns during pregnancy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: Examine women's in-vehicle travel behavior during pregnancy and examine the difference in travel data collected by questionnaire and global positioning system (GPS) and their potential for exposure error.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We measured work-related travel patterns in 56 pregnant women using a questionnaire and one-week GPS tracking three times during pregnancy (<20 weeks, 20-30 weeks, and >30 weeks of gestation). We compared self-reported activities with GPS-derived trip distance and duration, and examined potentially influential factors that may contribute to differences. We also described in-vehicle travel behavior by pregnancy periods and influences of demographic and personal factors on daily travel times. Finally, we estimated personal exposure to particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PB-PAH) and examined the magnitude of exposure misclassification using self-reported vs. GPS travel data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Subjects overestimated both trip duration and trip distance compared to the GPS data. We observed moderately high correlations between self-reported and GPS-recorded travel distance (home to work trips: r = 0.88; work to home trips: r = 0.80). Better agreement was observed between the GPS and the self-reported travel time for home to work trips (r = 0.77) than work to home trips (r = 0.64). The subjects on average spent 69 and 93 minutes traveling in vehicles daily based on the GPS and self-reported data, respectively. Longer daily travel time was observed among participants in early pregnancy, and during certain pregnancy periods in women with higher education attainment, higher income, and no children. When comparing self-reported vs. GPS data, we found that estimated personal exposure to PB-PAH did not differ remarkably at the population level, but the difference was large at an individual level.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Self-reported home-to-work data overestimated both trip duration and trip distance compared to GPS data. Significant differences in PAH exposure estimates were observed at individual level using self-reported vs. GPS data, which has important implications in air pollution epidemiological studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: People's time-location patterns are important in air pollution exposure assessment because pollution levels may vary considerably by location. A growing number of studies are using global positioning systems (GPS) to track people's time-location patterns. Many portable GPS units that archive location are commercially available at a cost that makes their use feasible for epidemiological studies. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of five portable GPS data loggers and two GPS cell phones by examining positional accuracy in typical locations (indoor, outdoor, in-vehicle) and factors that influence satellite reception (building material, building type), acquisition time (cold and warm start), battery life, and adequacy of memory for data storage. We examined stationary locations (eg, indoor, outdoor) and mobile environments (eg, walking, traveling by vehicle or bus) and compared GPS locations to highly-resolved US Geological Survey (USGS) and Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangle (DOQQ) maps. RESULTS: The battery life of our tested instruments ranged from {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}9 hours to 48 hours. The acquisition of location time after startup ranged from a few seconds to {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}20 minutes and varied significantly by building structure type and by cold or warm start. No GPS device was found to have consistently superior performance with regard to spatial accuracy and signal loss. At fixed outdoor locations, 65{\%}-95{\%} of GPS points fell within 20-m of the corresponding DOQQ locations for all the devices. At fixed indoor locations, 50{\%}-80{\%} of GPS points fell within 20-m of the corresponding DOQQ locations for all the devices except one. Most of the GPS devices performed well during commuting on a freeway, with {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}80{\%} of points within 10-m of the DOQQ route, but the performance was significantly impacted by surrounding structures on surface streets in highly urbanized areas. CONCLUSIONS: All the tested GPS devices had limitations, but we identified several devices which showed promising performance for tracking subjects' time location patterns in epidemiological studies.},

abstract = {Background: Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) has been linked to various adverse health outcomes. Personal PAH exposures are usually measured by personal monitoring or biomarkers, which are costly and impractical for a large population. Modeling is a cost-effective alternative to characterize personal PAH exposure although challenges exist because the PAH exposure can be highly variable between locations and individuals in non-occupational settings. In this study we developed models to estimate personal inhalation exposures to particle-bound PAH (PB-PAH) using data from global positioning system (GPS) time-activity tracking data, traffic activity, and questionnaire information. Methods: We conducted real-time (1-min interval) personal PB-PAH exposure sampling coupled with GPS tracking in 28 non-smoking women for one to three sessions and one to nine days each session from August 2009 to November 2010 in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, California. Each subject filled out a baseline questionnaire and environmental and behavior questionnaires on their typical activities in the previous three months. A validated model was used to classify major time-activity patterns (indoor, in-vehicle, and other) based on the raw GPS data. Multiple-linear regression and mixed effect models were developed to estimate averaged daily and subject-level PB-PAH exposures. The covariates we examined included day of week and time of day, GPS-based time-activity and GPS speed, traffic-and roadway-related parameters, meteorological variables (i.e. temperature, wind speed, relative humidity), and socio-demographic variables and occupational exposures from the questionnaire. Results: We measured personal PB-PAH exposures for 180 days with more than 6 h of valid data on each day. The adjusted R-2 of the model was 0.58 for personal daily exposures, 0.61 for subject-level personal exposures, and 0.75 for subject-level micro-environmental exposures. The amount of time in vehicle (averaging 4.5{\%} of total sampling time) explained 48{\%} of the variance in daily personal PB-PAH exposure and 39{\%} of the variance in subject-level exposure. The other major predictors of PB-PAH exposures included length-weighted traffic count, work-related exposures, and percent of weekday time. Conclusion: We successfully developed regression models to estimate PB-PAH exposures based on GPS-tracking data, traffic data, and simple questionnaire information. Time in vehicle was the most important determinant of personal PB-PAH exposure in this population. We demonstrated the importance of coupling real-time exposure measures with GPS time-activity tracking in personal air pollution exposure assessment.},

Participants' bikes were fitted with Schoberer Rad Me{\ss}technik to monitor speed, power output and heart rate during the cycle discipline. Global positioning system was worn to determine speed and heart rate during the swim and run disciplines.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULT: An even swim pacing strategy was adopted across all distances. A more stochastic pacing was observed during the HIM cycle [standard deviation of exposure variation analysis (EVASD) = 3.21 ± 0.61] when compared with the sprint cycle discipline (EVASD = 3.84 ± 0.44, p = 0.018). Only 20.9 ± 4.1 {\%} of the cycling time was spent more than 10 {\%} above the mean power output in the HIM, compared with 43.8 ± 2.9 {\%} (p = 0.002) and 37.7 ± 11.1 {\%} (p = 0.039) during the sprint and Olympic distance triathlons, respectively.

This paper, with the sample data collected by The Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study, discusses the process of how to utilize data obtained from GPS and inclinometer device, along with basic information about participants to conduct travel survey, and reconstructing participant's commuting behaviour. In the analyses of the sample, the procedure of datasets integration through DELPHI programming and protocols established to determine corresponding commuting behaviour are discussed. The details of commuting behaviour illustrated in this study included travel mode, travel duration, allocation of trip stages, and corresponding level of physical activities. This paper discusses a promise for applying advanced technologies in travel survey instead of traditional ones in terms of accuracy and reliability; it discusses the feasibility to discover the coherent relationship between health outcome and commuting behaviour from travel-tracking technologies.},

abstract = {This study examined relationships among individual demographics, environmental features (e.g., fast food outlet density, park land use) of residential neighborhoods and activity spaces, and weight-related behaviors (diet, physical activity). Participants' movement was tracked for 7 days using global positioning systems (GPS). Two activity space measures (one standard deviation ellipse, daily path area) were derived from the GPS data. Activity spaces were generally larger than residential neighborhoods; environmental features of residential neighborhoods and activity spaces were weakly associated; and some activity space environmental features were related to dietary behaviors. Activity spaces may provide new insights into environmental influences on obesity-related behaviors. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To introduce Agent-Based Model (ABM) to physical activity (PA) research and, using data from a study of neighborhood walkability and walking behavior, to illustrate parameters for an ABM of walking behavior.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: The concept, brief history, mechanism, major components, key steps, advantages, and limitations of ABM were first introduced. For illustration, 10 participants (age in years: mean = 68, SD = 8) were recruited from a walkable and a nonwalkable neighborhood. They wore AMP 331 triaxial accelerometers and GeoLogger GPA tracking devices for 21 days. Data were analyzed using conventional statistics and highresolution geographic image analysis, which focused on a) path length, b) path duration, c) number of GPS reporting points, and d) interaction between distances and time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Average steps by subjects ranged from 1810-10,453 steps per day (mean = 6899, SD = 3823). No statistical difference in walking behavior was found between neighborhoods (Walkable = 6710 ± 2781, Nonwalkable = 7096 ± 4674). Three environment parameters (ie, sidewalk, crosswalk, and path) were identified for future ABM simulation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: ABM should provide a better understanding of PA behavior's interaction with the environment, as illustrated using a real-life example. PA field should take advantage of ABM in future research.},

@article{zunzer_energy_2013,
abstract = {The purpose of the study was to assess the average physical intensity and energy expenditure during a single round of golf on hilly and flat courses in a heterogeneous group of healthy men and women of varying age and golf handicap. Forty-two males and 24 females completed an incremental cycle-ergometer exercise test to determine exercise performance markers. The heart rate (HR), duration, distance, walking speed, ascent and descent were measured via a global positioning system (GPS)/HR monitor during the game and energy expenditure was calculated. Playing 9 or 18-holes of golf, independent of the golf course design, the average HR was not significantly different between sexes or the subgroups. The intensities were light with respect to the percentage of maximal HR and metabolic equivalents of task (METs). Total energy expenditure of all participants was not significantly different for hilly (834 ± 344 kcal) vs. flat courses (833 ± 295 kcal) whereas male players expended significantly greater energy than female players (926 ± 292 vs. 556 ± 180 kcal), but did not have significantly greater relative energy expenditure (2.8 ± 0.8 vs. 2.2 ± 0.7 METs). As a high volume physical activity, playing golf is suggested to yield health benefits. Since the intensity was well below recommended limits, golf may have health related benefits unrelated to the intensity level of the activity.},
